<h3>THATE, APOCALIPSE, FUTURO </h3>

3. Are apocalypses only about the future? (THATE, 2016, p. 289)


<h3>THATE, APOCALIPSE, REVELAÇÃO</h3>

As such, in the exploration of everyday apocalypses, we
must always ask what is uncovered or revealed? Who is revealing and
who is receiving revelation? And what are the media through which
such communication is occurring or being covered up? (THATE, 2016, p. 290)


<h3>THATE, APOCALIPSE, NOSTALGIA</h3>

In order to demonstrate this point, I
want to introduce the mirror image of apocalypse: nostalgia. Naturally,
we tend to think of nostalgia as having to do with the past, but, again,
this is not entirely the case. (THATE, 2016, p. 290)


<h3>THATE, APOCALIPSE, NOSTALGIA</h3>

In both apocalypse and nostalgia,
the past and the future are used to leverage present concerns and
highlight unease with current states of affairs. Two examples from the
world of film best demonstrate this. (THATE, 2016, p. 290)


<h3>THATE, APOCALIPSE, RELIGIÃO, TEMPO</h3>

When we hear words like “apocalypse,”
we tend to think of them as forms of religious thought. Religion,
whatever it might mean, is, in many respects, a matter of assorting
meaning to time—or a way of allocating time meaningfully (THATE, 2016, p. 294)


<h3>THATE, APOCALIPSE, TEMPO</h3>

Apocalypses, likewise, are
about measuring the meaning of time. They are about ordering and
periodizing time according to some predisposed meaning. And yet, as
with nostalgia and the past, apocalypses are about imagining things as
they might one day be in order to grapple with the way things currently
are. (THATE, 2016, p. 294)
