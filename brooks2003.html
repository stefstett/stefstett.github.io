<h3>BROOKS, ZUMBI, HUMANO</h3>
F. Sixth Sense Historical research, coupled with laboratory and field observation, have shown that the walking dead have been known to attack even when all their sensory organs have been damaged or completely decomposed. Does this mean that zombies  possess  a sixth sense? Perhaps. Living humans use less than 5 percent of their brain capacity. It is possible that the virus  can stimulate another sensory ability that has been forgotten by evolution. This theory is  one of the most  hotly debated in the war against the  undead. So far, no scientific evidence has been found to support either side. (BROOKS, 2003:05)

<h3>BROOKS, AUTÃ”MATO, ZUMBI</h3>
No matter who  a person was in his former  life, that person is  gone, replaced by  a mindless automaton with no instinct other than for feeding. This begs the  question: Why do zombies prefer urban areas to the countryside? First, the  undead do not prefer cities, but simply remain where they are reanimated. Second, the main reason zombies tend to stay in cities instead of fanning out into the countryside is because an urban zone holds the highest concentration of prey. (BROOKS, 2003:08)

    <h3>BROOKS, FALA, ZUMBI, </h3>
E. CommunicationZombies have  no language skills. Although their  vocal cords are capable of speech, their brain is  not. The  only vocal ability appears to be  a deepthroated moan. This moan is released when zombies identify prey. The sound will remain low and steady until  physical contact is made. It will then shift in tone and volume as the zombie commences its attack. This eerie sound, so typically associated with the walking dead, serves as  a rallying cry for other zombies and, as has been recently discovered, is  a  potent psychological weapon.
