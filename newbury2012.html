             <h3>NEWBURY, 28 DAYS LATER, CAPITALISMO</h3>
            
            As Jim passes by a Costa
Coffee franchise (a British peer of Starbucks), the camera takes
conspicuous note of the shop and its logo, featuring them in five
different, nearly consecutive shots. In the main lobby, Jim finds a
ripped-open Pepsi machine, its contents spilled by the dozens:
7-up, Pepsi, Tango, and other brands form a pool of cans on the
tiled floor. Jim pops the top of a Pepsi, and, in a kind of nightmarish play on contemporary advertising, tips his head back and desperately guzzles the soda. Much of it sloshes down his cheek in
the process. Two more vending machines, one bearing a huge
version of the Mars logo, the other the logo for Tango soft drinks,
stand in the background. There may be no people around, and the
world appears to be in disarray, but Jim still stands in front of a
formidable bank of snack food and drinking options (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 87). 
            
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, ALIMENTO </h3>  
            
            Or maybe it would be
better to say that Jim is surrounded not by food at all, but by what
the bestselling food writer Michael Pollan calls “foodlike substances,” a cornucopia of corn syrup and snack foods with many polysyllabic additives and preservatives that anyone outside of food
science would have trouble pronouncing (In Defense of Food 1).
Food itself, in any relatively nonprocessed, unbranded, or locally
produced form, simply isn’t available in this dystopic vision (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 88)
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, INDUSTRIALISMO, CONSUMISMO</h3>    
            
            The dislodging of humans from their comfortable place atop the industrial food chain is, in the end, one of
the central, even defining features of recent zombie films. In them,
models of Western modernity necessarily become scavengers,
hunters and gatherers, locavores on the landscape of a devastated
consumerism emblematized crucially by the flotsam and jetsam of
corporate junk and fast food (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 90)
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, ALIMENTO, APOCALIPSE, ECONOMIA</h3>
            
            But, as 28 Days Later has already begun to suggest, such
yearnings for the pastoral, for the local, for slow food tend to be
utterly crushed in zombie films. Indeed, as we shall see, the
zombie films, precisely in the indulgence of their exploitative
excesses, routinely offer a critique far more radical than—and
even beyond the imagination of—the public intellectuals and journalists warning of food-related catastrophe. Indeed, where these
writers fashion to varying degrees an idealized return to the
“natural” as a solution to the corporate remaking of food, zombie
films insist in their imagery of apocalypse on the problematic provisionality of any such reference to the “natural,” offering instead
a world and food that are always and inescapably made by cultural
and economic power (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 91)
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, ALIMENTO, INDÚSTRIA </h3>  
            
            The contemporary zombie movie extinguishes with brutal
enthusiasm all aspirations to retrieving the pastoral, the natural, or
alternatives to the industrial food chain. To put this proposition in
terms that fans of the zombie movie might understand, by the time
the undead or infected appear, idealized retreats to pre-zombie,
pre-corporate, pre-industrial, and pre-apocalyptic alternatives are
simply impossible (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 97)
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, APOCALIPSE</h3>   
            
            When the zombie movie does
narrate temporary returns to the pastoral and to alternative foodways, it does so only to undermine their plausibility as effective
reactions to the apocalyptic crisis (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 98)
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, MONOCULTURAS, CAPITALISMO, COLONIALISMO</h3> 
            
            The
sugar plantations, of course, stand as emblems of powerfully intrusive Western capital and colonialism and the problems that may
attend the exportation of power, but how and what people eat
barely seem to register in these movies. The sugar plantations are
sites of exploitation, but are not in meaningful ways particularized
or politicized as parts of a corporate food chain (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 98)
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, ALIMENTO</h3>
            
            But if the narrative catalyst for
the zombie apocalypse in recent films is often attached to government, weapons research, medical corporations, or rogue scientists,
the visual apparatus of the films inescapably makes of corporate
food an essential emblem of broader social impoverishment and
decay that precedes, enables, and later emblematizes society’s
collapse (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 100)
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, BIOZOMBIE</h3> 
            
             In
Biozombie (1998), a Japanese film, the biological agent responsible
for the zombie outbreak is originally concealed in a soda bottle that people mistakenly drink from before they turn cannibalistic (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 102-103)
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, ALIMENTO</h3>
            
            In the recent zombie film, acts and sites of slow and local
food consumption are also often initially coded as meaningful
antidotes to the calamitous present. Survivors in the barren,
fast-and-franchised-food landscapes of zombie films find with surprising frequency opportunities to explore culinary and dining
counterpoints to the fast and industrial food surrounding them.
One might not expect to see this, but candlelight dinners appear
with some frequency in zombie films; discovered bottles of fine
wine and whiskey are savored; even direct or implied tributes to
the environmental and social virtues of vegetarianism turn up
repeatedly, not least in the recent advent of the zombie who
aspires to a vegetarian diet (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 103)
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, CONSUMISMO</h3> 
            
            Rather, the fast and the accelerated infected are pure products
and emblems of a particularly virulent and frantic consumerism
signified crucially by their near constant association with fast and
industrial food. The question of their speed and singular focus
here is entirely to the political point. If, to the chagrin of
food-apocalypse writers, “slow” food has increasingly become
“fast,” then the slow zombie has also been accelerated and intensified as the embodiment of a consumer signified by blindly
focused, violent, and apocalyptic eating habits. On the one hand,
the “infected” or “fast” zombies might be seen as locavores surviving on the landscape around them, but they have, unfortunately
and paradoxically, turned eating local into the quintessential act of
fast-food consumption. Eating without regard to consequence or
cultural tradition is all that zombies do (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 104).
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, ALIMENTO</h3>   
            
            The
food one eats and the way one eats it become primary signifiers of
distinction between the malevolent dead or infected and those
struggling to retrieve or retain a measure of human distinction
from them. Just as journalistic accounts of the food apocalypse
tend to offer a series of pastoral and “slow” food images pulling
audiences back from the abyss of sorrow and lament that they cultivate, apocalyptic landscapes littered with potato chips, soda cups,
and half-eaten bodies in the zombie movie intermittently yield to
the pastoral and to highly personalized, slow-food moments (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 104)
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, ALIMENTO</h3> 
            
            That is to say, the candlelight dinner scenes seek to
recover not just a world before zombies turned up, but a world
before the dominance of corporate and fast food, a world prior to
the cultural and economic environment to which the living dead
are so tightly bound. Where the journalistic versions of apocalyptic food writing tend to allow for precisely this kind of redemptive self-realization through individual choices at the cash register
and shopping at farmer’s markets, zombie movies find such
hopes and aspirations thoroughly unsustainable in the face of the corporate, cultural, and economic forces that dominate their
landscapes (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 106-107)
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, DAY OF THE DEAD </h3> 
            
            In the remake of Day of the Dead, after being bitten on the
hand by one of the infected, Private Bud Crain (Stark Sands)
slowly transforms in appearance into one of them, even as he continues to accompany fellow humans struggling to survive. While
his zombie brethren burst out of chocolate cafe´s and move in
packs to disembowel and eat anyone not carrying the transformative virus, Bud, uniquely among them, remains uninterested in
making fast food out of people. Riding nervously beside Bud in a
humvee, one streetwise soldier, making reference to Michael
Jackson’s 1983 music video, needs an explanation for Bud’s
peacefulness and gets it from another rider: “This shit is ridiculous. Why Thriller over here ain’t trying to eat us?” “He’s a
vegetarian.... They seem to retain some part of themselves before
they were infected.” (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 107)
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, DAY OF THE DEAD, VEGETARIANISMO</h3>
            
            In the context of the movies, this is a self
that resists the apocalyptic vision of the zombie film, a self humanized through the rejection of mindless, instinctive, and rabid food
consumption. Vegetarianism, like the candlelight dinner, promises
a way out of zombiehood, an opting out of the corporate food
chain and the apocalyptic visions with which it is associated (NEWBURY, 2012, 109)
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, CRISE ALIMENTAR</h3>
            
            Zombie films show in particularly striking ways the depth
and breadth of cultural penetration that food-crisis thinking has
achieved. In the zombie movie, the discourse of food disaster has
moved beyond the need to express itself in any linear or expository
fashion, past the need to make an argument for itself at all.
Instead, the overdetermined imagery of a food apocalypse in the
zombie film operates as a taken-for-granted, shared vocabulary,
even in films that would not seem to be targeted with any care or
precision at the consumer of organic produce or pastured beef,
pork, and chicken (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 111)
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, ALIMENTO</h3> 
            
            The familiar imagery of corporate food disaster so abundant
in recent zombie movies, though, tells us only part of the reason
why such films should be important to those interested in
American studies, cultural studies, and environmental studies.
These films not only elucidate increasingly familiar terms of crisis,
they also suggest with striking brutality the cultural dynamics through which alternative food ways and efforts to resist hegemonic norms might be routinely absorbed, co-opted, or simply overwhelmed by consumer consent, marketing forces, and the primal
attractiveness of salt, fat, sugar, and richly enhanced artificial flavoring (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 111-112)
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, ALIMENTO INDUSTRIAL </h3>
            
            Indeed, as I have
implied throughout, it might be fair to say that the zombie
movie is less given to systematic, linear, and coherent exposition on the troubles of industrial food than are food-crisis
writers and documentarians. The films offer instead a visually
spectacular, shockingly impressionistic but also total critique of
producers and consumers of industrial food. They are unrestrained in their visualizations of the horror of modern eating,
shifting rapidly from scenes of junk-food consumption to the
cannibalistic, with both played out against a backdrop of corporate food logos (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 112)
            
             <h3>NEWBURY, ALIMENTO</h3>  
            
            The
contemporary zombie movie, in short, is singularly and creatively alert to the difficulty of discovering alternatives outside
the systemic power that brings food-like substances and brutally
produced meat to our stores, our homes, our tables, and,
finally, our stomachs (NEWBURY, 2012, p. 113)
