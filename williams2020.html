<h3>WILLIAMS, WHITEWASHING, RAÇA, TROPOS</h3>
            Throughout its existence the American film industry has--through the stories it has chosen to tell as
well as discriminatory practices such as whitewashing and the erasure of non-White people--
enshrined whiteness as the default American racial identity. In multiracial films, Hollywood
productions have historically employed racialized character tropes to further emphasize hegemonic
American whiteness (WILLIAMS, 2020:xi)
            
<h3>WILLIAMS, SUPREMACIA BRANCA</h3>
            Findings
further reveal more nuanced ways that biopics, while featuring Black protagonists, can still be
firmly rooted in White supremacy; especially if they adhere to the tropes and subscribe to the
underlying assumptions of seemingly unimportant linchpin characters. (WILLIAMS, 2020:xi)
            
<h3>WILLIAMS, ADICHIE, REPRESENTAÇÃO, RAÇA </h3>
            The American film industry does not reflect the demographics of the United States
(Erigha, 2015); although initiatives exist to increase diversity at every level in American majorstudio filmmaking, White men are overrepresented, and racial minorities and women are still
disproportionately underrepresented (Hunt, Ramón, Tran, Sargent, & Diaz, 2017). In her TED
Talk, author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie discusses how simple it is for an audience to
unknowingly internalize and uncritically accept a “single story,” something that they have heard
enough times for it to become an unquestioned truth: “The single story creates stereotypes, and
the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make
one story become the only story” (Adichie, 2009). (WILLIAMS, 2020:01)
            
<h3>WILLIAMS, RAÇA, HOLLYWOOD</h3>
            Hollywood films have historically focused
primarily on telling the stories of White characters, even in films where non-White characters
should be included or at the forefront [i.e., casting decisions that Whitewash narratives] (BonillaSilva, 2012, p. 179). And in those films where Black characters are the protagonists, there are
often “little [W]hite patriarchal interventions all along the way” (Wallace, 1986, p. 26) to prevent
the film’s perspective from straying too far afield of typical Hollywood productions (WILLIAMS, 2020:02)
            
<h3>WILLIAMS, RAÇA, TROPOS</h3>
            Underrepresentation of non-male, non-White performers in Hollywood permits racial character
tropes’ continued existence in the face of data which seem to indicate that audiences are willing
to embrace more complex and diverse characterizations (Hunt, Ramón, Tran, Sargent, & Diaz,
2017) (WILLIAMS, 2020:02)
            
<h3>WILLIAMS, WHITE GAZE</h3>
            CWS
examine the power and pervasive nature of the White gaze, which is the way in which the
dominant White culture’s view of society shapes perception and action, with such influence also
being exerted on the media that is produced within said society (WILLIAMS, 2020:03)
            
<h3>WILLIAMS, WHITE GAZE</h3>
            The White gaze
presupposes a White audience, and art that is made from this perspective seeks to contextualize
or explain the lives and actions of non-White people or cultures, based upon the assumption that
White people would find these unfamiliar or discomfiting. This perspective reinforces the
dominant cultural tradition of viewing people of color as objects to be deciphered and
commodified, or as others who exist to be exploited by White people for labor, financial,
entertainment, and/or sexual purposes.(WILLIAMS, 2020:05)
            
<h3>WILLIAMS, BRANQUITUDE </h3>
            CWS scholars believe that whiteness is: a
modern invention whose meaning is able to shift over time; a social norm that is associated with
certain unspoken privileges; and a construct that can be dismantled for the betterment of all
humanity (Nayak, 2007) (WILLIAMS, 2020:05)
            
<h3>WILLIAMS, BRANQUITUDE </h3>
            One way that whiteness has survived as the dominant and normative identity in American
identity is through adaptation. American history has shown the boundaries of whiteness to be
malleable and permeable. That certain ethnic groups, including Irish and Italian Americans, have
since ascended to the pantheon of whiteness in the United States when they were, upon first
arrival, not invited to share in the societal benefits of whiteness, demonstrates the mutability of
this racial categorization (WILLIAMS, 2020:06)
            
<h3>WILLIAMS, WHITE SAVIOR </h3>
            While Hollywood still makes and
rewards White savior movies such as Green Book (Farrelly, 2018), these movies appeal largely
to White people and are less in favor with the audiences of color who comprise the majority of
the American movie ticket-buying public (Hunt et al., 2019) (WILLIAMS, 2020:06)
            
<h3>WILLIAMS, BRANQUITUDE, WHITE GAZE </h3>
            The supremacy of whiteness in the United States is reinforced through the White gaze.
By positioning whiteness as the default American racial identity and reserving racial descriptors
primarily for non-White people, whiteness is essentially removed from inclusion in the category
of all racial identities. Bonilla-Silva offers the following description of this process: “Racial
domination necessitates something like a grammar to normalize the standards of White
supremacy as the standards for all sorts of everyday transactions rendering domination almost
invisible” (2012, p. 174) (WILLIAMS, 2020:07)
            
<h3>WILLIAMS, WHITE SAVIOR</h3>
            The White savior character is a racial trope found in dramatic films which take place in
predominantly non-White settings. Hughey describes this character as a teacher or leader who,
through personal sacrifice, is able to elevate the social or educational circumstances of lowerclass people, saving them from some unfortunate fate (2009). This figure often stands apart from
his White contemporaries; he may be an outcast before embarking upon his messianic actions
performed on behalf of browner, less fortunate others or perhaps specifically because of these
actions (Vera & Gordon, 2003). The White savior’s presence in a movie conflates whiteness with
bravery, natural leadership, and kindness, while further reinforcing notions of other ethnic
groups being comprised of dependent, faithful followers who are just waiting to be led.  (WILLIAMS, 2020:08)
            
<h3>WILLIAMS, CONHECIMENTO</h3>
            Although it is perfectly understandable that people regard movies as an uncomplicated
form of entertainment, while we are being entertained, we are also internalizing the messages
that filmmakers may not even be aware they are putting into their films. Given that films are the
primary means of people's acquisition of historical knowledge (Landy, 2001), it is especially
important to understand what is being communicated to viewers while they think they are simply
being entertained. (WILLIAMS, 2020:14)
