<h3>READ, FUNGO, SIMBIOSE</h3>

In most higher plants, symbiotic fungi are
central to the process of nutrient capture
from soil1. Evidence from fossils of the
earliest land plants2, as well as molecular
studies3, confirms that roots co-evolved with
fungal partners to form structures known
as mycorrhizas — literally, ‘fungus-roots’(READ, 1997, p. 517)

<h3>READ, SIMBIOSE, FUNGO</h3>

The study of Simard et al.4 (page 579 of
this issue) is important in this context. Not
only does it address these complex questions
in a field situation but, for the first time,
it shows unequivocally that considerable
amounts of carbon — the energy currency
of all ecosystems — can flow through the
hyphae of shared fungal symbionts from tree
to tree, indeed, from species to species, in a
temperate forest (READ, 1997, p. 517)

<h3>READ, ÁRVORES, SIMBIOSE, FUNGO</h3>

As a result, the
roots of trees such as the Douglas fir or birch
can be colonized by many fungal species, the
mycelia of which extend from tree to tree,
providing linkages between them. The lack
of specificity ensures that, in an undisturbed
forest ecosystem, almost all of the trees —
irrespective of their taxonomic affinities —
are interconnected by a diverse population
of mycelial systems. Groups of tree species
joined together in this way have been
recognized as functional guilds6 (READ, 1997, p. 517)

<h3>READ, ÁRVORE, FLORESTA</h3>

Perhaps of greatest ecological significance is the demonstration that when the fir
was in the shade, there was a considerable
increase in the amount of carbon that it
received from the birch. Most forest trees
spend the early part of their lives as seedlings
in the gloom of the forest floor. If, as indicated by this work, the direction of flux is determined by the carbon status of the recipient,
the carbon economy of this shaded understorey will be subsidized by fully illuminated
overstorey plants, through pathways provided by their fungal symbionts (READ, 1997, p. 518)

<h3>READ, COLONIZAÇÃO MICORRÍZICA</h3>

The observation that carbon is transferred between green plants will stimulate us
to examine forest ecosystems from a fresh
standpoint. It indicates that we should place
less emphasis on competition between
plants, and more on the distribution of
resources within the community. If mycorrhizal colonization results in an equalization of resource availability, as suggested by
this and a number of microcosm studies, it
would be expected to reduce dominance of
aggressive species, so promoting coexistence
and greater biodiversity (READ, 1997, p. 518)
