            <h3>ROUTLEY, OCIDENTE, CIVILIZAÇÃO, AMBIENTE</h3>
            
            It is increasingly said that civilization, Western civilization at least, stands in need of a new
ethic (and derivatively of a new economics) setting out people's relations to the natural environment, in Leopold's words 'an ethic dealing with man's relation. to land and to the animals and
plants which grow upon it' ([ 1], p. 238) (ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 205)

            <h3>ROUTLEY, ÉTICA, NATUREZA</h3>
            
            It is not of course that old and prevaling ethics do not deal
with man's relation to nature: they do, and on the prevailing view man is free to deal with nature as
he pleases, i.e. his relations with nature, insofar at least as they do not affect others, are not subject
to moral censure (ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 205)

            <h3>ROUTLEY, TRADIÇÃO DOMINANTE, POSIÇÃO DESPÓTICA, CUSTÓDIA, APERFEIÇOADOR</h3>
            
           Indeed Passmore (in [2]) has mapped out three important traditions in Western ethical views
concerning man's relation to nature; a dominant tradition, the despotic position, with man as
despot (or tyrant), and two lesser traditions, the stewardship position, with man as custodian, and
the co-operative position with man as perfector. Nor are these the only traditions; primitivism is
another, and both romanticism and mysticism have influenced Western views (ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 206)

            <h3>ROUTLEY, OCIDENTE, TRADIÇÃO, ÉTICA AMBIENTAL, </h3>
            
            As the important Western traditions exclude an environmental ethic, it would appear that
such an ethic, not primitive, mystical or romantic, would be new alright. The matter is not so
straightforward; for the dominant ethic has been substantially qualified by the rider that one is riot
always entitled to do as one pleases where this physically interferes with others (ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 206)

            <h3>ROUTLEY, FILOSOFIA LIBERAL, OCIDENTE, CHAUVINISMO HUMANO</h3>
            
            'The liberal philosophy of the Western world holds that one should be able to do what he
wishes, providing (1) that he does not harm others and (2) that he is not likely to harm himself
irreparably.'
Let us call this principle basic (human) chauvinism - because under it humans, or people,
come first and everything else a bad last - though sometimes the principle is hailed as a freedom
principle because it gives permission to perform a wide range of actions (including actions which
mess up the environment and natural things) providing they do not harm others (ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 207)

            <h3>ROUTLEY, EXEMPLO DO ÚLTIMO HOMEM</h3>
            
            (I) The last man example. The last man (or person) surviving the collapse of the world system
lays about h1m, eliminating, as far as he can, every living thing, animal or plant (but painlessly if
you like, as at the best abattoirs). What he does is quite permissible according to basic chauvinism,
but on environmental grounds what he does is wrong. Moreover one does not have to be committed to esoteric values to regard Mr. Last Man as behaving badly (the reason being perhaps that radical thinking and values have shtfted in an environmental direction in advance of corresponding
shifts in the formulatiOn of fundamental evaluative principles) (ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 207)

            <h3>ROUTLEY, TEORIA ÉTICA, TEORIA ECONÔMICA, CHAUVINISMO</h3>
            
            These ethical and economic theories are not alone in their species chauvinism; much the
same applies to most going meta-ethical theories which, unlike intuitionistic theories, try to offer
some rationale for their basic principles. For instance, on social contract positions obligations are a
matter of mutual agreements between individuals of the base class; on a social justice picture rights
and obligations spring from the application of symmetrical fairness principles to members of the
base class, usually a rather special class of persons, while on a Kantian position which has some
vague obligations somehow arise from respect for members of the base class, persons. In each case
if members of the base class happen to be ill-disposed to items outside the base class then that is
too bad for them: that is (rough) justice (ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 210
