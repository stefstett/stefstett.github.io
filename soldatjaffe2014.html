             <h3>SOLDAT-JAFFE, PONTYPOOL, LINGUAGEM</h3>
            
            When Sydney and Grant, the two main characters in <i>Pontypool</i> (2009), realize that the disease that transforms humans into zombies might be carried through language - specifically, English language - they look for a source. In the sudden realization that <i>understanding</i> language is the source, Sydney asks Grant, "How do you stop understanding? How do you make it strange?". Such questions point to crucial issues concerning the nature of human language and the possibility of zombie language (SOLDAT-JAFFE, 2014, p. 361)
            
             <h3>SOLDAT-JAFFE, LINGUAGEM</h3>
            
            Does language always involve meaningful exchange? (SOLDAT-JAFFE, 2014, p. 362)
            
             <h3>SOLDAT-JAFFE, LINGUAGEM, NÃO-HUMANO</h3>
            
            We come across many examples in culture and science in which the a-human human - the automaton, the anthropoid, the undead - lacks language, the artificial or unnatural creation unable to communicate and therefore deficient of the rational thinking that typically defines humanness (SOLDAT-JAFFE, 2014, p. 362)
            
             <h3>SOLDAT-JAFFE, LINGUAGEM, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            In <i>The Land of the Dead</i> (2005) the film's human protagonist Riley uses reconnaissance about zombie communication to include both the living and the living dead in his definition of <i>people</i> (SOLDAT-JAFFE, 2014, p. 365) 
            
             <h3>SOLDAT-JAFFE, LINGUAGEM</h3>
            
            To establish if Rick is a "walker" and whether he should be "put down", the boy's father, Morgan, inquires whether Rick's unconscious, insensate body before him "said something". Duane responds affirmatively: "He did. I think he called me 'Carl'". To this Morgan replies, "Son, you know that they [the zombies] don't talk!". The observation of language use - what's more, communicative address - saves Rick's life when Morgan and Duane thereafter pull his human body to safety (SOLDAT-JAFFE, 2014, p. 366)
            
             <h3>SOLDAT-JAFFE, DEFINIÇÃO, LINGUAGEM</h3>
            
            Among these he [n.a. Charles F. Hockett] singles out seven design features specifit to human languages: semanticity, arbitrariness, discreteness, displacement, productivity, traditional transmission, and duality of patterning. These features conclusively define human language as arbitrary but meaningful - in other words, as a culturally contractual relationship between the signifier and the signified (SOLDAT-JAFFE, 2014, p. 366)
            
             <h3>SOLDAT-JAFFE, PONTYPOOL, LINGUAGEM</h3>
            
            In <i>Pontypool</i> the state officials provide a public announcemen in French that outlines a plan for protection that is seemingly informed by Vygotsky's theory of social speech, because it spells out that (1) only the English language is infected; (2) survivors must restrain from all terms of endearment; and (3) survivors must avoid contact with close family members (SOLDAT-JAFFE, 2014, p. 367)
            
             <h3>SOLDAT-JAFFE, BENJAMIN, LINGUAGEM</h3>
            
            Benjamin differentiates between "the mental being" ("<i>geistiges Wesen</i>) and "the linguistic being" ("<i>sprachliches Wesen</i>). Whereas the linguistic being (thing, zombie) can communicate its existence but fails to comprehend because it lacks something of mental meaning ("<i>daseiendes Geistiges</i>"), the mental being uses language to recognize ("<i>erkennen</i>"): "it articulates itself in the fact that man recognizes himself in language. Awareness is possible only in the sphere in which the mind communicates itself in language. The things do not understand, man does" (<i>Gesammelte Schriften</i> 787; my translation) (SOLDAT-JAFFE, 2014, p. 367)
            
             <h3>SOLDAT-JAFFE, LINGUAGEM, BENJAMIN, VIDA </h3>
            
            Language may be undead, yet language use, returning to Benjamin, is the only way to recognize the state of life, and as such language is expected to deny a priori a dying person's ability to verbalize that he or she is dead (SOLDAT-JAFFE, 2014, p. 369)
            
             <h3>SOLDAT-JAFFE, LINGUAGEM, DEFINIÇÃO</h3>
            
            Instead of asking <i>what language is</i> (the definition approach), the functional approach - <i>what language does</i> - offers us more insight into the zombie language problem (SOLDAT-JAFFE, 2014, p. 370)
            
             <h3>SOLDAT-JAFFE, SIGNIFICACDO, LINGUAGEM, VÍRUS, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO</h3>
            
            Thus, it seems here that meaning (and, as suggested by the authorities' broadcasted instructions, the meaning of particular words) has alwars been the carrier of the zombie virus, and the lack of meaning is the first symptom of the "zombification" process, but the lack of meaning also ultimately helps to defy the virus if applied in a timely manner (SOLDAT-JAFFE, 2014, p. 372)
            
             <h3>SOLDAT-JAFFE, SIGNIFICADO, CULTURA, LINGUAGEM, HUMANIDADE</h3>
            
            Whereas meaning, as Vygotsky puts it, is a construct of culture, the reflection <i>on</i> meaning, the skill to manage the arbitrariness of language - to revisit Hockett - that protects the language user from the absurd and limits his or her freedom to use language ("not everything goes") as the proposition has fulfill the truth requirement) is a mental process that is human specific (SOLDAT-JAFFE, 2014, p. 373)
            
             <h3>SOLDAT-JAFFE, LINGUAGEM, CONSCIÊNCIA </h3>
            
            This assessment is in agreement with William S. Larkin's work in which he inquires what a person is and under what conditions a person continues to exist - that is, when do we say that a person is a <i>res cogitans</i> (a thinking thing) or just a <i>res corpo realis</i> (a bodily thing)? (SOLDAT-JAFFE, 2014, p. 373)
            
             <h3>SOLDAT-JAFFE, LINGUAGEM, DIFERENCIAÇÃO, BARULHO, NOTLD, BEN</h3>
            
            If language is commonly used as a categorical distinction between what is a zombie and who is human, the notion of <i>noise</i> introduces a new complexity into the discussion. In <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> (1968), Ben gets into an argument with Harry about the relation between noise and communication. Famously, Ben chides Harry for failing to unlock the door to the cellar hideout, because zombies threaten to enter. Having ignored shouts for help from the people upstairs as they try to fight the zombies back, Harry later defends his nonaction by claiming that he misunderstood" the noise (SOLDAT-JAFFE, 2014, p. 374)
            
             <h3>SOLDAT-JAFFE, BEN, BARULHO, SIGNIFICADO, LINGUAGEM</h3>
            
            As such, Ben's definition of noise goes beyond aimless accidental disturbance; his assessment of noise includes attention-seeking (targeted) communication devices - a plea for help or the expression of fear, for instance. So why do zombies not produce what we would consider meaningful noise? The short answer would be that they do not have the brain processing to do so (SOLDAT-JAFFE, 2014, p. 375)
            
             <h3>SOLDAT-JAFFE, TWD, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            The zombie brain lacks this complexity - at least, in the versions Dr. Jenner anatomizes in <i>The Walking Dead</i>. He explains to the group, using a computer model called Test Subject 19, the processes in the brain that take place when a person is bitten and then partially revived as a walker. Jenner maintains that upon infection the human brain first shows deathlike symptoms and then returns to only very limited functionality (SOLDAT-JAFFE, 2014, p. 375)
            
             <h3>SOLDAT-JAFFE, TWD, LINGUAGEM</h3>
            
            In <i>The Walking Dead</i> grunting is not just an atrophied means of communication but a life-saving device when Glen and Rick pretend to be zombies in an attempt to get to a box truck that is supposed to help them escape the invaded city of Atlanta (SOLDAT-JAFFE, 2014, p. 377)
