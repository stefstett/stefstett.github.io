            <h3>PIFER, SHAUN OF THE DEAD</h3>
            
            Pegg and Wright take an existing cultural monster, the zombie - specifically the classic Romero zombie - and show that these horrible monsters are not all that different from the people desperately trying to avoid or kill them (PIFER, 2011, p. 163-164)
            
            <h3>PIFER, SHAUN OF THE DEAD, DAWN OF THE DEAD </h3>
            
            The zombie-like London citizens in <i>Shaun</i>'s opening resemble <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>'s mall zombies, who ride the escalators and stumble through the mall because of some preternatural memory of that place. Our entire society appears to be effected. We are not alone in the zombie condition (PIFER, 2011, p. 165)
            
            <h3>PIFER, SHAUN OF THE DEAD </h3>
            
            But slackers like Shaun, who has never fully given himself to the job he doesn't want - or Ed, who has never accepted a job - resist the deading affects of capitalism society (PIFER, 2011, p. 167)
            
            <h3>PIFER, ROMERO, VIDEO GAME</h3>
            
            Critics such as Roger Ebert note that Romero's zombie trilogy has changed our notion of the zombie: "George Romero, who invented the modern genre with <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> and <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>, was essentically devising video games targets before they were video games: They pop up, one after another, and you shoot them" (PIFER, 2011, p. 169)
            
            <h3>PIFER, SHAUN OF THE DEAD</h3>
            
            For instance, when Ed hits a pedestrian with Pete's car, Shaun is racked with guilt, cautiously calling out to the body in the street. Qhen the corpse reveals its snarling zombie visage, Shaun says "Oh, thank heavens for that", and we can breathe a sigh of relief. We thought for a moment that our protagonist had killed someone. Thankfully, the victim was <i>just</i> a zombie (PIFER, 2011, p. 169)
            
            <h3>PIFER, BINARIDADE, SHAUN OF THE DEAD </h3>
            
            What <i>Shaun</i> emphasizes is that the simple living/dead binary is insufficient to describe the relationship between the film's zombies and the living characters; the dead walk among and threaten the living, yet the living themselves resemble the dead (PIFER, 2011, p. 170)
            
            <h3>PIFER, SHAUN OF THE DEAD</h3>
            
            At that moment, Zombie Philip, who has been snarling and waving his arm about, finally manages to turn Ed's music off, and he sighs and relaxes. A classic Romero zombie would have never stopped trying to get out of the car to pursue its living victims. This zombis just seems to want some peace and quiet, just as the living Philip would have. The zombies in <i>Shaun of the Dead</i> are part of a living/dead binary, yet they simultaneously deconstruct this binary, appearing to be more "and/or" than "either/or", as Barbara Johnson suggests (PIFER, 2011, p. 171)      .
