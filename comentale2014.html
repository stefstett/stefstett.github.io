            <h3>COMENTALE, RAÇA, ZUMBI, ESCRAVIDÃO, COLONIALISMO, FANON, SARTRE, MONSTRUOSIDADE</h3>
            
            In talking race and zombies we begin with the deathliness dispersed everywhere through slavery and colonial power. If the figure of the zombie emerges from the slave trade of Africa and stalks the West bearing traces of this trauma, its threat lies precisely in its forced abandonment of humanist ethics and expression. Take, for instance, Jean-Paul Sartre's famous introduction to Frantz Fanon's <i>Wretched of the Earth</i>. Here, in a explicitly Marxist reading, Sartre casts colonization as a violent system of exploitation that results in the production of "monstrosities" (COMENTALE, 2014, p. 278)
            
            <h3>COMENTALE, COLONIZAÇÃO, METÁFORA, MODERNO, POLÍTICA</h3>
            
            Similarly, the zombie as a figure of colonization and its reversal, seeks nothing of expression or metaphor; rather, in the dark movement of its body, its voice, and in the rhythms and repetitions of its presence, it exposes a differente kind of modernity anda a different kind of politics (COMENTALE, 2014, p. 280)
            
            <h3>COMENTALE, SEABROOK, CONTAMINAÇÃO, COLONIALISMO, CULTURA, OCIDENTAL, ZUMBI, HASCO</h3>
            
            As Seabrook notes, this cross-cultural contamination swings both ways, an apparent by-product of colonial history. Western culture and civilization might find itself perverted by the heart of darkness here, but what is perhaps his story's most ghastly moment, Seabrook learns that most of the island's zombies are associated with Hasco, an American corporation (COMENTALE, 2014, p. 281)
            
            <h3>COMENTALE, SEABROOK, OCIDENTAL</h3>
            
            While Polynice fears the zombie because it signals the endless indenture of black slavery, Seabrook himself seems most horrified by the way it defied the representational system upon which Western power is based (COMENTALE, 2014, p. 282)
            
            <h3>COMENTALE, COLONIZAÇÃO, REPRESENTAÇÃO, NARRATIVA</h3>
            
            In all such stories, though, the threat of "reverse colonization" occurs at the borders of representation, via sound and rhythm rather than symbol and narrative (COMENTALE, 2014, p. 283)
            
            <h3>COMENTALE, HURSTON, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO</h3>
            
            But Hurston, the writer, seems most interested in zombification as an act of inscription, one in which a human body is taken out of one story and forced to inhabit another (COMENTALE, 2014, p. 288)
            
            <h3>COMENTALE, DOLAR, VOZ</h3>
            
            As Mladen Dolar writes, if the human voice serves to mediate body and sign, to reconcile matter to meaning, it also everywhere threatens to expose the incoherence and incompletion of being (COMENTALE, 2014, p. 297)
            
            <h3>COMENTALE, VOZ, IDENTIDADE, AGÊNCIA, MIDDLETON, GRAVAÇÃO</h3>
            
            In stressing the vexed ontological status of such voices, however, we begin to see how they might establish identity and agency on new terms. Recording technology, Middleton argues, exposes the voice as an always already undead voice, as a constant displacement of human nature beyond nature, and thus as the constant mediation of human identity beyond itself (COMENTALE, 2014, p. 298)
            
            <h3>COMENTALE, MONSTRUOSIDADE, ALTERIDADE, ABJEÇÃO</h3>
            
            Monstrosity reveals itself not as simple otherness or even abjection, but as the syncopated process of becoming, the halting movement of bodies within and against the official regimes of space and time (COMENTALE, 2014, p. 305-206)
            
            <h3>COMENTALE, ZUMBI, BEN, NOTLD, POLÍTICA, CULTURA</h3>
            
            To see the zombie as an opacity, as an obscure density of noncalcified substance, shuffling within fields of similar densities, strips the genre of all humanist claims. To see not just the zombie but a human protagonist such as Ben in <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> as an opacity, as a cut and groove, circulating within and against the cuts and grooves of white history at large, transforms the very terms of all politics as cultural politics (COMENTALE, 2014, p. 306)
            
            <h3>COMENTALE, ZUMBI, TERRITORIALIZAÇÃO</h3>
            
            In this zombie's body appears less as a dancing machine than more generally as a territorializing refrain, an aggregate of forms that in its jerky repetition marks out a space and time of operation-rhythm, in Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's formulation, as a functional assemblage, a series of motivs and counterpoints that works to catalyse bodies in relation to one another and thus as an instance of power (COMENTALE, 2014, p. 306)
            
            <h3>COMENTALE, SPINOZA, CORPO</h3>
            
            Here, Benedict de Spinoza provides the best model, for his early modern view of bodies and ethics speaks clearest to our late modern, posthuman view of hordes and masses. As philosopher of immanence, Spinoza deals only in substances and modes; in his <i>Ethics</i> the human body figures as a mode of extension, a modality, affected by other modalities, by the shapes, sizes, and speed of all other bodies. "All bodies either move or are at rest", Spinoza writes, as if constructing his own zombology. "Each body moves now more slowly, now more quickly". For Spinoza, such bodies do not vary in substance, but in affect, insofar as they are affected by one another, modified in their relations with one another, and sometimes, together, form a composite body, or a horde. [...] Importantly, for Spinoza, the virtue of any body is defined as its power to persist in its own form and relation. (COMENTALE, 2014, p. 307).
            
            <h3>COMENTALE, ZUMBI, VIRTUDE, HUMANIDADE, TERROR</h3>
            
            Indeed, <i>zombie</i> may be merely another name for "virtue" itself, the body's ability to persist in its own being and power. The zombie attack appears as an attack only from within a humanist worldview; it merely exposes power as such, as the rhythmic appropriation of time and space, and, in response, we need to translate our affective terror into adequate reason and ethical inquiry (COMENTALE, 2014, p. 308)
