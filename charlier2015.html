              <h3>CHARLIER, ZUMBI, HAITI, VOODOO, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO</h3>
            
            The diverse testimonies that I successfully obtained from <i>hougans</i> or undertakers more-or-less describe the process. In Haiti, the deceased person is buried within 24 hours after death. In the event of zombification, in order to shorten this amount of time, the <i>bokor</i> (a Vodou priest practicing evil magic) must spread a vile-smelling liquid (emanating from a corpse in an advanced state of decomposition) around the house in order to pretend that there is an urgency to carrying out the burial. To lure the deceased out of his grave, the <i>bokor</i> or his aides use one of the victim's spiritual element that they has previously kept and stored in a bottle (the <i>ti-bon-anj</i>) to turn him into a zombie. The <i>bokor</i> places himself at the foot of the grave with the bottle and makes the individuall rise up. Attracted by its "soul fragment", the body will be removedfrom the tomb. Unable to leave alone, the deceased is exhumed by the <i>bokor's</i> aides, the <i>loups-garous</i> (usually masons from the cemetery or individuals who bathe the dead, or even grave diggers) who shatter the masonry of the tomb, made of thin mortar - that is, with very little cement. Next, they take hold of the casket that they position head first in order to rush blood into the head of the "deceased". They bring out the body and rub it vigorously to relax the muscles and stimulate circulation. Finally, in order to finish awakening him completely, the <i>loups-garous</i> either make the individual swallow a potion made of <i>concombre zombi</i> leaves soaked in clarion (a strong alcohol) or they make him breathe the smoke of the same leaved that they burn at his feet. Next, they spray the zombie with icy water to finish awakening his senses, then violent lashes are administered to him with a whip to stimulate his nervous, peripheral, sensitive, and motor systems (and particularly to enable him to walk again in an effective way). They close his jaws with a strip of cloth to prevent him from screaming. Then, a <i>condeur</i> (or <i>conducteur</i>) wraps him up in a cloth shroud )so that he is not recognized by the night-time wanderers who might run into the strange convoy) and he puts a rope around his waist to adjust the cloth better so as not to impede his ability to walk. Then, the <i>condeur</i> leads him to the <i>bokor's</i> home. The <i>condeur</i> holds on to the other end of the rope. Sometimes the zombie's two arms are fastened at his back, sometimes his two thumbs are tied in front of him to unbalance him in the event that he attempts to run away (wrists or thumbs thus tied, he would fall imediately and would be very easy to catch) (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 09-10)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, ZOMBIE, ESCRAVIZADO, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO</h3>
            
            The zombie represents the ideal of the individual who s enslaved to others. He places himself in the service of whoever ordered the act of zombification, a sort of punishment that is perhaps worse than death itself, as it is generally dictated by revenge and vengeance. The zobie will be put to work in a sugar cane field, or, because he is frightening, he will serve as the protector of a house (to monitor the walls or the people who live there). In any case, he toils. (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 11)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, DOENÇA DE COTARD, ZUMBI, OCIDENTAL, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO</h3>
            
             Cotard's disease. [...] For Laënnec Hurbon, this psychiatric view is too Western, and this third type of zombie matches the social zombie to a great extent (for whom toxic substances do not systematically interfere): the individual himself, in fact, recounts the story of his own zombification, whether it was a fantasy (caused by the individual himself) or caused by anotoher person. The zombie is already structured by society (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 12)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, VOODOO</h3>
            
            But of what is this body made? First, it is a pile of flesh around which two spiritual elements are structured. The first (<i>petit bon ange</i> or <i>ti-bon-anj</i> corresponds to the intrinsic part of the individual that is in contact with spirits (<i>loas</i>), memory, consciousness, and authority (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 14)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, VOODOO, HAITI, ESCRAVIZADOS</h3>
            
            Since the 1920s, both local and foreign university studies have made it possible to understand the organization and the mysticism of Haitian Vodou in a very specific way. These animistic beliefs are founded on the transmission of <i>Yoruba</i> magical-religious content from West Africa by means of the slave trade, including and especially through the intermediary of music (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 19)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, VOODOO, CORPO, MORTE</h3>
            
            In the Vodou religion, human beings are made up of five basic elements: body (the flesh that becomes the corpse after death), <i>n'ame</i> (the spirit that animates the flesh and which, also mortal, becomes an energy transmitted to the earth at the time of death), <i>z'étoile</i> (the star of destiny that lives in paradise at a distance away from the body), and <i>gwo-bon-anj</i> and <i>ti-bon-anj</i> (the two parts of the soul). (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 21)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, DAVIS, BEAUVOIR, ANTROPOLOGIA, MORTE</h3>
            
            According to what Wade Davis and Max Beauvoir learned from their anthropological and toxicological investigation, but also from Japanese evidence collected by a Dr. Kao, a set of syptoms slowing down vital functions tempoprarily settles into the person's system, leading as far as catalepsy (syncope) - in other words, up to a state of apparent death. In the absence of appropriate treatment, the victim ultimately dies (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 28)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, CLAIRVIUS, DAVIS, BEAUVOIR, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            At the conclusion of their investigation, Davis and Beauvoir succeeded in having the existence of such individuals, transformed by drugs, recognized officially and by the intertional scientific community. At the center of their evidence is a man named Clairvius Narcisse, who was found in a market in Artibonite (in the northern part of the island)several years after his "death". Sientifically speaking, this man, whom Davis and Beauvoir studied from every angle (as they did his family), can be considered zombie #1. His complete history has been taken, as have medical observations, whether concerning his death certificate, his funeral, his public inhumation (which was attested by many credible witnesses), his exhuation, his transit through hospitals, etc. The real toxicological research began when they sought to find out how Clairvius Narcisse became this zombie (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 28-29)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, DAVIS, VENENO, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO, BEAUVOIR, HAITI</h3>
            
            Wade Davis was the advocate for a single poison used for zombification (he had even already found the name of it: "poison zombie" or "zombinol". But Max Beauvoir, who, by nature, knows the Haitian soul better, attempted to explain to him that he was heading down the wrong path and that the problem was much more complex (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 30)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, ESTADOS UNIDOS, DAVIS, BEAUVOIR, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            At the conclusion of his fieldwork, and of testing conducted in the United States on samples collected from <i>bokors</i> and patients <i>in situ</i>, Davis could nonetheless identify roughly five different method permitting the more or less successful zombification of an individual, even if, as Max Beauvoir clarifies, drugs do not do everything. For him, psychology, education and societal pressure participate in nearly equal proportions in the creation of a zombie (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 30)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, TETRODOXINA</h3>
            
            Intoxication by tetrodoxin usually hows a progression of rather stereotypial clinical indicators. LEvel 1: Pins and needles (paresthesia) around the mouth, with gastrointestinal problems, including stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, diarrhea, etc. Level 2: Pins and needles (paresthesia) through the torso and the extremities, with appearance of paralysis and difficulty with coordination of movement. Level 3: Diffused paralysis, arterial hypotension, and aphasia. Level 4: Loss of consciousness, paralysis of respiratory muscles, severe arterial hypotension, and disturbance of cardiac rhythm. Simultaneously, hypoteria as well as significant slowing of heartbeats can occur, in such a way that the clinical situation resembles that of a state of apparent death (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 34)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, HAITI, ZUMBI, DAVIS, TETRODOXINA</h3>
            
            Until the 1980s, neither ethnologists not the local Haitian population specifically connected the tradition of zombies to simple magical practices or to the use of a still-unknown substance. Everything changed in 1983 with the publication of a sensational article signed by Canadian ethnobotanist Wade David, followed by the launch of a book aimed at the general public, then by the defense of his thesis. The hypothesis he defends is that of criminal poisoning of human subjects vic decoctions containing tetrodoxin at a sub-lethal dosage (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 35)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, RAVIX, TETRODOXINA</h3>
            
            Jacques Ravix is my first patient in Haiti,[...] In 1994, at age 53, he ran into problems with his spouse that were so substantial that they ended up separating. The mother of this woman sought retaliation against Jacques Ravix, and had him opisoned by tetrodoxin (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 37)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, RAVIX, VENENO</h3>
            
            As a clinicam physician, Jacques Ravix is particularly skillful in describing the syptoms of his poisoning. He affirms that the initial sensation is that of a deep euphoria. Then, "you gradually withdraw into the night." At the end of a month of exposuure, the first clinical signs have thus begun to appear. After the initial euphoria, a sort of insidious absence followed that worsened day by day. [...] Until one morning, he felt as if he were going to die, but a "quiet death," for the euphoria was still there. It was euphoria "that carried one away." (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 38)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, VOODOO, MORTE</h3>
            
            After the earthquake of 2010, some preachers also claimed that it was Vodou that had brought cholera. A veritable witch hunt followed, with a dozen <i>hougans</i> put to death by the mob (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 45)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, VOODOO, NEOCOLONIALISMO</h3>
            
            Not a day goes by without the Christian churches accumulating anti-Vodou lectures. Some simulate cases of possession inwhich the victim claims "to have a <i>loa</i> in his head,""to be the devil," "to be Lucifer," and other grossly distorted folklores which, for Erol Josué, subjugate the people and continue to "zombify society," establishing a form of neocolonialism to which the churches that grow "like corn" on the island bear witness (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 45)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, ESCRAVIZADOS, REVOLUÇÃO, COLONIZAÇÃO</h3>
            
            A tree had been planted by slaves in Bois-Caïman on the day of the ceremony of August 14, 1791. It was during this magical-religious ceremony that slaves gathered around <i>mambo</i> Cécile Fatiman drank the blood of a butchered black pig in order to make themselves invulnerable to the colonizers' bullets (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 45)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, BOUKMAN, VOODOO, COLONIZAÇÃO</h3>
            
            Yet the prayer of Dutty Boukman (one of the leaders of the Bois-Caïman caremony) was an invocation of the Vodou gods (the <i>loas</i>), but also a text of profound tolerance that raises itself up against the colonizer's lack of understanding (and that of his god):<br><br>
            The god who created the earth, who created the sun which gives us light.<br>
            The god who holds back the oceans, who ensures the roaring of thunder.<br>
            God who has ears to hear: you who are hidden in the clouds, who shows us where we are, you see that the white man has made us suffer.<br>
            The God of the white man asks him to commit crimes.<br>
            But the God inside of us wants us to do good.<br>
            Our God, who is so good, so just, commands us to avenge ourselves for our wrongdoings.<br>
            It is he who guides our weapons and who will bring us victory.<br>
            It is he who will help us.<br>
            We should reject the image of the god of the white man who is so merciless.<br>
            Listen to the voice of freedom that sings in all of our hearts. (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 46)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, HAITI, RITUAL</h3>
            
            In Haiti, to make an offering is not necessarily a sign of allegiance or a mark of membership in one religion more than another. It is mainly linked to the fact that when one speaks to a divinity - no matter which - one must give it something in exchange for the expressed wish. Tit for tat. Such as when one goes to church gives to the collection during mass (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 51)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, ZUMBI, CIÊNCIA, ZUNBIFICAÇÃO, BRANQUITUDE</h3> 
            
             The phenomenon of zombies has inspired many scientists, including the least honest and the most audacious. Some, in fact, intend to use zombification as an experimental practice designed to heal ilnesses deemed grave and incurable, such as diabetes or HIV infection. In theirwork (especially controversial and, quite obviously, certainly not recognized by the international community), they actually claim that some subjects suffering from these ilnesses were involuntarily "whitened" (in other words, "healed" or "made better") after their poisoning by tetradotoxin (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 72)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO, VOODOO</h3>
            
            But when one decides to zombify an individual, one is choosing to condemn him to a loss of identity, possessions, everything. This is also done because Vodou does not allow the death penalty. Vodou does not kill - at least, it does not kill humans. Therefore, when someone is zombified, he is immersed in a type of coma, then removed from it a few hours later (so that the coma will be reversible, for if the individual stays too long in his casket, he will end up dying), taken out of the cemetery, and passed through what they call "trails of enchantment." (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 87)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, DAVIS, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            In other words, when Wade Davis and his North American colleagues worked on samples of <i>poudre zombi</i>, they only scratched the surface of this phenomenon (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 89)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, BRASIL, CANDOMBLÉ, RITUAL</h3>
            
            In Brazil, in the <i>candomblé</i>, the same protection rituals are practiced. When a <i>fils-de-saint</i> (<i>filho-de-santo</i>) dies, they beat the drums in front of the body for seven days. "You must not let him out of your sight." (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 90)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, HAITI, OCIDENTAL, VOODOO, CLASSE</h3>
            
            There are two development models in Haiti that coexist, but which are not yet in dialogue with each other: the Westernized model, on the one hand, and the popular mainstream model, on the other. Each one tries to destroy the other, but the forces are not equal, because money is not on the side of the Vodou practitioner (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 91)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, VOODOO, ZUMBI, DEFINIÇÃO</h3>
            
            The Vodou religion acknowledges the existence of three different zombie types (which, in reality, are interrelated): the astral zombie relates to an element of the soul that can be transmuted according to the will of the person who possesses it (usually the <i>bokor</i>); the corpse zombie is a "living dead" that can be forced to work; the marsh zombie corresponds to a former zombie of the flesh who has returned to a state of living (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 94)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, ZUMBI, VOODOO, SAL, CARNE</h3>
            
            They were obviously zombies... and Vodou tradition reports that if a zombie one day eats salt or meat, then he becomes aware of his horrible condition, cries all the tears from his body and immediately returns to the path that leads toward his grave (in order words, his natural place) (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 94-95) 
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, HURSTON, HAITI</h3>
            
            Thus, in 1937, the African American ethnologist Zora Neale Hurston earns a Guggenheim fellowship to go to Haiti and Jamaica in order to conduct research on the local culture (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 96)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, HURSTON, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO, METREUX</h3>
            
            How can we know what the truth is? For Zora Hurston, zombification was the punishment for those who had betrayed the mysteries of the secret Haitian societies. But no one believed her. "Zora Hurston is very superstitious," the French ethnologist Alfred Métreux condescendingly wrote (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 98)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, CLAIRVIUS</h3>
            
            At 1:15 p.m. on May 2, 1962, the now-famous Clairvius Narcisse, <i>alias</i> Louis Ozias, passes away at Albert-Schweitzer Hospital in the city of Deschapelles, a short distance from his <i>lakou</i> in Estère. He had been admitted three days earlier with a fever and sore muscles, spitting blood, before quickly sinking into a coma. His death was certified by two Western physicians and the cause of death was recorded in the medical record as "malignant hypertension and uremia." The body, identified by his family, was buried the next day. Eighteen years later, a man claiming to be Clairvius Narcisse gets in touch with one of his sisters (Angelina), confirming that he had been bewitched and zombified. He describes his state from the point as conscious, but, paralyzed at the moment of his death and burial, he was powerless to defend himself against his exhumation by a group of men presumed to be the <i>bokor</i> and his gang. For two years, he was beaten and enslaved on a plantation until another worker killed his abductor (or, according to another version, until one of his guards forgot to give him his daily dose of drugs). Clairvius then got away in a state that he describes as dreamlike and completely sluggish, without any of his own will any more. Haing finally regained consciousness, he chose to remainout of sight until the death of the brother with whom he was on bad terms before his zombification, and whom he had accused of having paid the <i>bokor</i> to poison him. Holding his Bible in one hand, he ended up dying many years later, all in likelihood of natural causes (pneumonia). His family buried him in Haiti in a cemetery belonging to an American mission (he had become an evangelist). Clairvius Narcisse did not, however, have one of the characteristic signs of zombies (and of <i>guédés</i>, those <i>loas</i> of the dead): a twangy voice (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 98-99).
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, ZUMBI, ÁFRICA CENTRAL</h3>
            
            The belief in zombies exists in certain parts of Africa. The word zombie originates, incidentally, from the diverse ethnicities of Central Africa and directly relates to wandering spirits or ghosts (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 103)
            
              <h3>CHARLIER, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO</h3>
            
            Only a few behaviors are particularly rebuked and lead to zombification: excessive ambition, fighting over inheritance, taking a woman from another man, and defamation. "Legal" errors are infrequent, if not almost unknown, or the object of totally reasonable isolated acts commited by the <i>bokors</i> who end up being zombified themselves by secret societies shortly thereafter (CHARLIER, 2015, p. 109)
