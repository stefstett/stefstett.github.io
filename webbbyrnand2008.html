             <h3>WEBB & BYRNAND, GLOBALIZAÇÃO</h3>  
            
            Because the idea of zombie travels so widely, and across so many fields, it has
become a very familiar character, one that participates in narratives of the body,
of life and death, of good and evil; one that gestures to alterity, racism, species-ism,
the inescapable, the immutable. Thus it takes us to ‘the other side’ – alienation,
death, and what is worse than death: the state of being undead (WEBB & BYRNAND, 2008, p. 83)
            
             <h3>WEBB & BYRNAND, ESPAÇO </h3> 
            
            Like humans, zombies aren’t social isolates – they seem to prefer to live in
groups, within built environments; like us, they actively colonize spaces for
themselves; like us – at least in the West – they seek to spread well beyond their
local region, and to dominate people and places. Consequently, though we do not
know their points of origin, we typically come across them in the most ordinary
and safe of environments – our own home ground (WEBB & BYRNAND, 2012, p. 84)
            
             <h3>WEBB & BYRNAND, 28 DAYS LATER </h3>  
            
             The zombies in this film have been infected with a viral rage; Jim
avoids the infection, but can’t avoid or control his innate, personal rage. The
effect in either case is practically identical: for all intents and purposes, in the
moments of his rage Jim is zombie. In fact, the deleted scenes show Jim running
unmolested among a pack of the infected to gain entry into the soldiers’ house:
he sides with the zombies in order to kill his human tormentors, and even the
zombies can’t tell that he’s not one of them (WEBB & BYRNAND, 2008, p. 86)
            
             <h3>WEBB & BYRNAND, DESEJO, NECESSIDADE</h3> 
            
            So here is a point at which humans and zombies diverge. We desire, constantly
seeking that which we do not have in order to fill the empty place of the self;
zombies show no signs of independent identity or understanding of the lack at
the heart of the self.1 We need, constantly searching out what the body requires
to maintain physical life; zombies seem not to respond to the normal requirements of the body for rest, nourishment and shelter. So when it comes to both need and desire, humans operate according to a different economy from that of
zombies (WEBB & BYRNAND, 2008, p. 87-88).
            
             <h3>WEBB & BYRNAND, CAPITALISMO </h3>
            
            Capitalism, we suggest, works as an analogue of zombiedom because it too is
predicated on insatiable appetite, and the drive to consume. But it is not necessarily the mindless consumption of the zombie (WEBB & BYRNAND, 2008, p. 89)
            
             <h3>WEBB & BYRNAND, CONSUMISMO, CAPITALISMO</h3>
            
            Taking Marx and Engels’ point, we can say that being human is
about more than basic hungers; it is about individuals organizing to achieve aims,
and thus all our needs and hungers are peculiarly social and cultural, and hence
peculiarly mediated. There is something unthinking, unthought, about zombie
consumption; there is something organized, systematic, about capitalist consumption (WEBB & BYRNAND, 2008, p. 89)
            
             <h3>WEBB & BYRNAND, HUMANIDADE, ZUMBI </h3> 
            
            They show, too, what is perhaps the most devastating aspect
of zombie as metaphor for the current economy: there is no (evident) way out.
Your only option, when faced with the zombie menace, is to kill or be killed.
Either way you’re screwed, because you are dead, or you have become what you
fear. The act of violence that removes the horror and threat of the zombie reconstructs me, the human, as zombie – a being that is only body, without empathy,
without respect for life: very like the marketplace, in fact (WEBB & BYRNAND, 2008, p. 91)
            
             <h3>WEBB & BYRNAND, GLOBALIZAÇÃO</h3>  
            
            The issue is not that we all begin to buy the same kind of jeans and eat the
same potato chips, but that this apparently most democratic system of economic
management leads not to a democracy of wealth, but to a divided society in both
global and local terms: the few-too-few who have nearly everything, and the
many-too-many who are reduced to little or nothing. Those multitudes comprise
what Heidegger termed ‘the standing army’ of workers, crowds of shoppers at
the mall, the couch potatoes on a million sofas across the nation, all reduced to
unthinking obedience and/or consumption – to zombie (WEBB & BYRNAND, 2008, p. 92)
            
             <h3>WEBB & BYRNAND, CAPITALISMO </h3> 
            
            So
            many of the examples – the <i>Dead</i> series, <i>Last Man on Earth</i>, <i>The Omega Man</i> or
<i>28 Days Later</i> – show the heart of capitalist settlement littered with the detritus
of modern civilization: paper and old clothes drifting among the bodies on pavements, cars uselessly lining the streets, and looted stores opening wistfully out
onto the emptiness beyond. Perhaps what we can suggest about this use of the
trope is that the zombie is the worm that turned. Capitalism produced and overproduced it, and now it is eating capitalism (WEBB & BYRNAND, 2008, p. 92)
            
             <h3>WEBB & BYRNAND, EMOÇÃO, HUMANIDADE</h3> 
            
            Richard Cytowic points out the inadequacy
of using an android logic to approach the workings of the mind, writing: ‘All
analogues of the mind to a machine are inadequate because it is emotion, much
more than reason, that makes us human’ (1993: 156, his emphasis) (WEBB & BYRNAND, 2008, p. 94)
            
             <h3>WEBB & BYRNAND, ORGANISMO COGNITIVO</h3>  
            
            ‘Living systems’, biologist Humberto Maturana writes, ‘are cognitive systems,
and living as a process is a process of cognition’ (Maturana and Varela, 1980: 13).
While zombies are not precisely living – in the human sense – they’re not dead
either, or inanimate. Instead, they seem to fulfil some of the main requirements
of a cognitive organism, specifically the aspect biologists call autopoiesis: ‘a way of establishing and maintaining a system’s boundary by selecting meaningful
elements – or distinctions the system can use – out of an otherwise indistinct,
“noisy”, environment’ (cited in Tabbi, 2002: xxiii) (WEBB & BYRNAND, 2008, p. 94-95)
            
             <h3>WEBB & BYRNAND, ORGANISMO COGNITIVO, HUMANIDADE</h3>
            
            In this
definition, zombies are also living, cognitive entities. They are biological phenomena because their brains clearly undertake at least some information-processing
activities; after all, they generally retain some memory of their pre-zombie lives,
and this capacity is surely found only in the functioning brain. Zombies have
discrimination too, in the sense that they respond to their environment; and they
are capable of some quality of interaction, whether to seek out and eat human
beings, or to huddle together in their dismal spaces (WEBB & BYRNAND, 2008, p. 95)
