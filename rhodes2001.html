<h2>RHODES, 2001</h2>

<h3>RHODES, HAITI, MORTO-VIVO, ZUMBI</h3>
In its meaning as a synonym for “living dead” or for the medical condition caused by powders or potions in Haiti, the term did appear in print earlier than one might expect: 1792, in Moreau de Saint-Méry’s text on the last years of white colonial rule in Haiti. HE separately defines revenants (spirits), loupgaroux (vampires) and zombis, which he says is a “Creole word that means spirit, revenant.” Given that his book was rarely seen or read - it was also published only in French - it held little if any influence in the history of English-speaking texts on the subject of voodoo and zombies. (RHODES, 2001, 75)
