<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

Disorderly, active nature was soon forced to submit to the questions and experimental techniques of the new science. Francis Bacon (1561-1626), a celebrated "father of modern science,"
transformed tendencies already extant in his own society into a total program advocating the £Ontrol of nature for human benefit. Melding together a new philosophy based on natural magic as a
technique: for manipulating nature, the technologies of mining and
metallurgy, the emerging· concept of progress and a patriarchal
structure of family and state, Bacon fashioned a new ethic sanctioning the exploitation of nature (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 164)

<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

Bacon transformed the magical tradition by calling on the need
to dominate nature not for the sole benefit of the individual magician but for the good of the entire human race; Through vivid metaphor, he transformed the magus from nature's servant to its exploiter, and nature from a teacher to a slave. Bacon argued that it
was the magician's error to consider art (technology) a mere "assistant·to nature having the power to finish what nature has begun"
and therefore to despair of ever "changing, transmuting, or fundamentally altering nature (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 169)

The first instance was the view of nature as immanent selfdevelopment, the nature naturing herself of the Aristotelians. This
was the organic view of nature as a living, growing, self-actualizing
being. The second state was necessary to explain the malfunctions
and monstrosities that frequently appeared and that could not have
been caused by God or another higher power acting on his instruction. Since monstrosities could not be explained by the action of form or spirit, they had to be the result of m2.tter acting " perversely.
Matter in Plato's Timaeus was recalcitrant and had to be forcefully
shaped by the demiurge. Bacon frequently described matter in female imagery, as a "common harlot." "Matter is not devoid of an (
appetite and inclination to dissolve the world and fall back into the
old Chaos." It therefore must be "restrained and kept in order by
the prevailing concord of things." "The vexations of art are· certainly as the bonds' and handcuffs of Proteus, which betray the ultimate
struggles and, efforts of matter(MERCHANT, 1989, p. 170-171)

Here, in bold sexual imagery, is the key feature of the modern
experimental method----constraint ·of nature in the laboratory, dissection by hand and mind, and the penetration of hidden secretslanguage still used today in praising a scientist's "hard facts,"
"penetrating mind," or the "thrust of his argument." (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 171)

<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

Scientific method, combined with mechanical technology, would
-create a "new organon," a new system of investigation, that unified
· knowledge with material power. The technological discoveries of
printing, gunpowder, and the magnet in the fields of learning, warfare, and navigation "help us to think about the secrets still locked
in nature's bosom." "They do not, like the old, merely exert a gentle guidance over nature's course; they have the power to conquer
and subdue her, to shake her to her foundations." Under the mechanical arts, "nature betrays her secrets more fully ... than when
in enjoyment of her natural liberty. (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 172)

In seventeenth-century England, the largest community of individuals, with the exception of the church and the court, was the patriarchal family, consisting of the immediate family and its servants, usually not larger than a dozen people. Emotional sustenance, discontent, and reconciliation of differences were centered
on the family. Love relationships, hatred, and tension existed within
the family group but could be dealt with at the level of the individual (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 173)

<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

Bacon's utopian society [<i>The New Atlantis</i>] therefore accepted the period's existing
social stratification, but displayed upward mobility in the case of
the "scientist," who was placed in the highest stratum. This structure contrasted sharply with the utopias of Campanella and Andrea. The white togas worn by all the citizens of the City of the Sun
can be viewed, not as a manifestation of uniformity or monastic severity, but as a protest against the stratification of status and
wealth reflected in fine, rich clothing. Likewise, in Christianopolis
all people wore gray or white clothing made of linen or wool, depending on the :season. "They have only two suits of clothes, one for
their work, one for the holidays; and for all classes they are made
alike .... None have fancy, tailored goods (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 176)

<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

The idea of scientific progress has been associated with the rise
of technology and "the requirements of early capitalistic economy"
by scholars who have argued that the idea of cooperation and the
sharing of knowledge for both the construction of theory and the
public good stemmed from the intellectual attitudes of sixteenthcentury master craftsmen, mechanical engineers, and a few academic scholars and humanists (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 179)

The scientific research institute designed to bring progress to Bensalem, the community of the New Atlantis, was called Salomon's House. The patriarchal character of this utopian society was reinforced by
designating the scientists as the "Fathers of Salomon's House." In
the New Atlantis, politics was replaced by scientific administration (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 180)

<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

Scientists decided which secrets were to be revealed to the state
as a whole and which were to remain the private property of the institute rather than becoming public knowledge: "And this we do
also, we have consultations, which of the inventions and experiences
which we have discovered shall be published, and which not: and all
take an oath of secrecy for the concealing of those which we think
fit to keep secret, though some of those we do reveal sometimes to
the state, and some not (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 181)

<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

Bacon's scientist not only looked but behaved like a priest who
had the power of absolving all human misery through science. He
"had an aspect as if he pitied men"; "he held up his bare "hand as
he went, as blessing the people, but in silence." The street was lined
with people who, it would seem, were happy, orderly, and completely passive: "The street was wonderfully well kept, so that there was
never any army {which] had their men stand ih better battle array
_than the people stood. The windows were not crowded, but everyone
stood in them as if they had been placed." (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 181)

Salomon's House, long held to be the prototype of a modern research institute, was a forerunner of the mechanistic mode of scientific investigation. The mechanical method that evolved during the
seventeenth century operated by breaking down a problem into its
component parts, isolating it from its environment, and solving each
portion independently. Bacon's research center maintained separate
"laboratories" for the study of mining and metals, weather, freshand salt-water life, cultivated plants, insects, and so on (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 182)

<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

In the laboratories of Salomon's House, one of the goals was to
recreate the natural environment artificially· through applied technology. Large, deep caves called the Lower Region were used for
"the imitation of natural mines and the producing of new artificial
metals by compositions and materials." 38 in another region were "a
number of artificial wells and fountains, made in imitation of th~
natural sources and baths." Salt water could be made fresh, for
••we have also pools, of which some do strain fresh water out of salt,
and others by art do turn fresh water into salt."  (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 182)

<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

The scientists of Salomon's House, not only produced new forms
of birds and beasts, but they also altered and created new species of
herbs and plants: "We have also means to make divers plants rise
by mixtures of earths without seeds, and likewise to make divers
new plants differing from the vulgar, and to make one tree or plant
turn into another." (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 183)

<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

The Baconian program, so important to the rise of Western science, contained within it a set of attitudes about nature and the scientist that reinforced the tendencies toward growth and progress inherent in early capitalism. While Bacon himself had no intimation
as to where his goals might ultimately lead, nor was he responsible
for modern attitudes, he was very sensitive to the trends and directions of his own time and voiced them eloquently. The expansive
tendencies of his period have continued, and the possibility of their
reversal is highly problematical. (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 185)

<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

 It would seem that the creation
of artificial products was one result of the Baconian drive toward
control and power over nature in which "The end of our foundation
is the knowledge of causes and secret motions of things and the enlarging of the bounds of human empire, to the effecting of all
things possible." 45 To this research program, modern genetic engineers have added new goals-the manipulation of genetic material
to create human life in artificial wombs, the duplication of living
organisms through cloning, and the breeding of new human beings
adapted to highly technological environments (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 186)

<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

The development of science as a
methodology for manipulating nature, and the interest of scientists
in the mechanical arts, became a significant program during the
latter half of the seventeenth century. Bacon's followers realized
even more clearly than Bacon himself the connections between mechanics, the trades, middle-class commercial interests, and the
domination of nature.  (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 186-187)

<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

Descartes wrote in his Discourse
on Method (1636) that through knowing the crafts of the artisans
and the forces of bodies we could "render ourselves the masters and
possessors of nature." 50 Joseph Glanvill, the English philosopher
who defended the Baconian program in his Plus Ultra of 1668, asserted that the objective of natural philosophy was to "enlarge
knowledge by observation and experiment ... so that nature being
known, it may be mastered, managed, and used in the services of
humane life." (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 188)

<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

In his "Experimental Essays" (1661), Boyle distinguished between merely knowing as opposed to dominating nature in thinly
veiled sexual metaphor: "I shall here briefly represent to you ...
that there are two very distinct ends that men may propound to
themselves in studying natural philosophy. For some men care only
to know nature, others desire to command her" and "to bring nature to be serviceable to their particular ends, whether of health, or
riches, or sensual delight." 52  (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 189)

The new image of nature as a female to be controlled and dissected through experiment legitimated the exploitation of na'tural
resources. Although the image of the nurturing earth popular in the
Renaissance did not vanish, it was superseded by new controlling
imagery. The constraints against penetration associated with the
earth-mother image were transformed into sanctions for denudation (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 189)

<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

The mechanical view of nature now taught in most Western
schools is accepted without question as our everyday, common sense
reality-matter is made up of atoms, colors occur by the reflection
of light waves of differing lengths, bodies obey the law of inertia,
and the sun is in the center of our solar system (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 193)

<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

The removal of animistic, organic assumptions about the cosmos
constituted the death of nature-the most far-reaching effect of the
Scientific Revolution. Because nature was now viewed as a system
of dead, inert particles moved by external, rather than inherent
• forces, the mechanical framework itself could legitimate the manipulation of nature. Moreover, as a conceptual framework, the mechanical order had associated with it a framework of values based
on power, fully compatible with the directions taken by commercial
capitalism (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 193)

<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

Against the background of the disorder in society, religion, and cosmology of the
late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, mechanism arose as
an antidote to intellectual uncertainty and as a new rational basis
for social stability. The emphasis on individual interpretation
brought about during the Reformation had raised the specter of the
anarchy of ideas and created the serious problem of the source of
certainty and authority in the sphere of knowledge. Martin Luther
(1483-1546) had challenged the authority of the pope and his
councils to determine religious truth by asserting that all Christians
had the power to discern truth or falsity for themselves through
reading the scriptures (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 194)

<h3>MERCHANT, </H3>

The mechanists transformed the body of the world and its female
soul, source of activity in the organic cosmos, into a mechanism of
inert matter in motion, translated the world spirit into a corpuscular ether, purged individual spirits from nature, and transformed
sympathies and antipathies into efficient causes. The resultant
corpse was a mechanical system of dead corpuscles, set into motion
by the Creator, so that each obeyed the law of inertia and moved
only by external contact with another moving body (MERCHANT, 1989, p. 195)
