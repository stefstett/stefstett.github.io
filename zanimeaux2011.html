             <h3>ZANI & MEAUX, DAWN OF THE DEAD, RELIGIÃO</h3>
            
            In <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> (1978), Romero would incorporate another crucial element, the religious or eschatological, with the tagline "When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth", implying a theological condemnation as the origin of the zombie - if the dead are among us, it is because we have filled the coffers of hell too quickly with our immoral behavior, and therefore have prematurely initiated the world's end (ZANI & MEAUX, 2011, p. 99)
            
             <h3>ZANI & MEAUX, FULCI, BIOLÓGICO, TEOLÓGICO, CORPÓREO, ESPECTRAL</h3>
            
            As we will argue, the choice of Fulci is not incidental; he represent the epitome of the zombie narrative precisely because the paradigms and defining elements of zombies in his multiple zombie films are never consistent. Fulci's films, where zombies constantly vacillate between biological and theological in origin, corporeal and spectral in substance, and individual and collective as threat, enable us to see that zombies represent more than just a black template for some historically particular anxiety about death (ZANI & MEAUX, 2011, p. 99)
            
             <h3>ZANI & MEAUX, ENTENDIMENTO HUMANO, TERROR, TRAUMA, FULCI</h3>
            
            His oeuvre offers a touchstone for the meaning of zombie narratives because it contains a constant, repetitive decay and dissolution of origin, order, and understanting. In these films, the things we hold to have meaning - even the very logic of narrative order - all become meaningless. Fulci's zombies represent the fallacy of human understanding, and the terror or trauma that comes of realizing that fallacy (ZANI & MEAUX, 2011, p. 99)
            
             <h3>ZANI & MEAUX, 28 DAYS LATER, TRAUMA</h3>
            
            The plot of Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's 2007 film <i>28 Days Later</i> is constructed entirely around this concept. In one of the film's major plot points, the young brother-and-sister protagonists, Andy and Tammy, who are living in a fortified city with their father, break quarantine, drawn to the idea of returning to their home. Given that they can only expect an empty home to return to, their action emphasizes the psychological stake that they (and by extension we, the viewers) have in the idea of home, with all that it implies about family, a shared past, and the value of community (ZANI & MEAUX, 2011, p. 102)
            
             <h3>ZANI & MEAUX, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, TRAUMA</h3>
            
            One mighy also consider the most recognizable image from George Romero's <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>: the close-up of the zombie child as she prepares to kell her own mother. The girl's face, which can be seen on posters and T-shirts around the world, is a kind of shorthand, communicating a range of emotions, including not only horror but also wry amusement. The image's power rests in the fact that it represents the destruction of the family as well as the annihilation of order itself (ZANI & MEAUX, 2011, p. 103)
            
             <h3>ZANI & MEAUX, PRAGA, CANIBALISMO</h3>
            
            The plague itself, when introduced, is labeled an "<i>Anthropophagized</i> plague" - that is, the plague is cannibalistic, referencing a classical myth, inspired by Herodotus, which tells of the <i>androphagy</i> - headless flesh eaters living on the Black Sea (ZANI & MEAUX, 2011, p. 103)
            
             <h3>ZANI & MEAUX, FAMÍLIA, RELIGIÃO, GOVERNO</h3>
            
            Are zombie narratives, then, about family, religion, and government? They are about that and more, or specifically they are about the dissolution of that and more (ZANI & MEAUX, 2011, p. 104)
            
             <h3>ZANI & MEAUX, CAMUS, FASCISMO</h3>
            
            While no critics would define <i>The Plague</i> [n.a. Camus] as an outright zombie narrative, understanding the connections between this plague account and the themes we have been discussing explains why many critics understand the novel as "among much else, a disguised account of the European struggle against fascism (ZANI & MEAUX, 2011, p. 107)
            
             <h3>ZANI & MEAUX, FULCI, ANSIEDADE, MEDO</h3>
            
            What is most fascinating about the films of Fulci is that he is not afraid to throw aside logic or narrative consistency in order to produce the desired effect of stimulating anxiety. The result is precisely our point in this article - that the central concern of zombie films has nothing to do with any manifest point plot (such as battling a literal virus or biological contagion), discovering the ultimate cause of the catastrophe (whether originating as moral censure from God, or the result of militarism or corporate greed), or some obvious political/moral agenda (such as fighting fascism in <i>The Plague</i> or as one might find, for example, in Romero's later, directly "political" work). Instead, these texts generate anxiety precisely because even the very fears they articulate are neither stable nor consistent. They refuse to become concrete and containable, and that lack of consistency, as such, is precisely what operates as a standard for zombie narratives (ZANI & MEAUX, 2011, p. 108)

            <h3>ZANI & MEAUX, FULCI, NATURAL</h3>
            
            So, which is it in this film, are the zombies supernatural or natural in origin? We argue that the popularity achieved by Fulci's films lies precisely in the fact that such questions are only to be raised rather than answered. The narrative not only refuses to answer its own questions, positions, and concerns (ZANI & MEAUX, 2011, p. 109)
            
            <h3>ZANI & MEAUX, FULCI, ZOMBIE HELL HOUSE</h3>
            
            A look at Fulci films other than <i>Zombi 2</i> reveals much the same. For example, <i>The House by the Cemetary</i> was released in 1981 in Italy as <i>Quella villa accanto al cimetero</i>, or <i> Zombie Hell House</i>, and by other titles in the United States (ZANI & MEAUX, 2011, p. 110)
            
            <h3>ZANI & MEAUX, FULCI</h3>
            
            But even more interesting is a strange theme of infidelity or deception that Fulci introduces but never fully explains. On multiple occasions in the story, it is suggested that Norman has visited the town sometime previously. Each time he is asked about this visits - for example, "Of course, you've been there before, haven't you Dr. Boyle?" - he refused to acknowledge them (ZANI & MEAUX, 2011, p. 111)
            
            <h3>ZANI & MEAUX, CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD, CORPO, SOBRENATURAL</h3>
            
            Take, for example, his 1980 work <i>The Gates of Hell</i> (<i>Paura nella città dei morti viventi</i>, also known as <i>City of the Living Dead</i>). The zombies in this film have an array of unusual abilities. As in <i>Zombi 2</i>, where the distinction between biological contagion and voodoo became so blurred as to be irrelevant, in <i>The Gates of Hell</i> the corporeal versus non-corporeal nature of the zombie is called into question. In one scene, a zombie priest causes a woman to bleed from the eyes and vomit forth her own intestines, an action taken from a distance, without any physical contact (ZANI & MEAUX, 2011, p. 112)
            
            <h3>ZANI & MEAUX, TUBARÃO, ZOMBI 2</h3>
            
            The temptation in watching Fulci films is to attempt to track down the answers to these questions. Why is a shark fighting a zombie and what are the larger implications of that for the plot? (ZANI & MEAUX, 2011, p. 113)
            
            <h3>ZANI & MEAUX, ENTENDIMENTO</h3>
            
            Even if these other films maintain more narrative consistency of cohesion that those of Fulci, the point is that loos of control, loss of meaning is constant in the zombie narrative (ZANI & MEAUX, 2011, p. 114)
            
            <h3>ZANI & MEAUX, FULCI, NARRATIVA</h3>
            
            Fulci's work uses the standard narrative tropes to question the nature of narrative itself, pointing out that the logical conclusions and resolutions are not essential. "Narrative", as most people understand it, consists of a chronological sequence of events following a pattern, eventually reaching a resolution, in which plot elements are concluded and questions, which the story itself poses to the reader or viewer, are answered. In Fulci, however, there is often an almost arbitrary sequence of events that does not contribute to a comforting resolution. In the course of multiple films, Fulci violates virtually every narrative convention (ZANI & MEAUX, 2011, p. 115)            .
