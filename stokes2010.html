<h3>STOKES, HUMANO, ZUMBI</h3>
The zombie is somehow enthralling, and it is my opinion that this is in part because the zombie is a study of what it means to be human in the postmodern world. (STOKES, 2010:ii)

<h3>STOKES, ZUMBI, HUMANIDADE</h3>
A study of this culture offers invaluable insight into our own contemporary Western society and culture, as the zombie provides a physical form, embodying our fears and anxieties into something that is sharable and valuable to an increasing number of people. (STOKES, 2010:ii)

<h3>STOKES, ZUMBI, CULTURA</h3>
 While the zombie has maintained its place as one of the most popular cinematic monsters in the history of horror, in the last decade an entire culture has built itself around the zombie. (STOKES, 2010:01)

<h3>STOKES, HUMANO</h3>
It is clear that zombies are appealing, but what is most fascinating is what zombies tell us about ourselves. (STOKES, 2010:03)

<h3>STOKES, ZUMBI, FILME</h3>
While zombie films maintain a very basic plot structure, each individual film is imbued with social commentaries; each explores a specific social and cultural fear or anxiety that corresponds to the social context of the film. (STOKES, 2010:03)

<h3>STOKES, ZUMBI, HAITI, VOODOO, WHITE ZOMBIE</h3>
Kyle Bishop, <b color="red">Shaun McIntosh</b> and others insist that the zombie originates solely from Haitian “voodoo” practices and legends of zombification, a practice which entered the cultural consciousness of the United States through stories developed into films such as White Zombie (1932) starring Bela Lugosi and Val Lewton’s I Walked with a Zombie (1943). (STOKES, 2010:08)

<h3>STOKES, ZUMBI, AUTÔMATO</h3>
Perhaps the automaton zombies from the films popular in the 1930s passed from folk culture into pop culture, but the 21st century notion of the undead zombie is indeed more closely related to Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein and Bram Stoker’s Dracula than Val Lewton’s possessed slave from I Walked with a Zombie. (STOKES, 2010:08)

<h3>STOKES, MCINTOSH, VOODOO, ROMERO</h3>
Shawn McIntosh’s article, “The Evolution of the Zombie: the Monster That Keeps Coming Back” focuses on the voodoo zombie and fails to make the clear connection between this older version of the monster and the contemporary zombie known from Romero’s films. (STOKES, 2010:09)

<h3>STOKES, ROMERO, NOTLD</h3>
 Romero claimed he derived the story of Night of the Living Dead from Richard Matheson’s I Am Legend (STOKES, 2010:09)

<h3>STOKES, VOODOO, ZUMBI, CINEMA</h3>
Among the distinctions is the important fact that voodoo  zombies can be controlled whereas other zombies are autonomous creatures. Not only are the voodoo zombies actual living people, but they remain in the control of a more powerful person. Brooks also points out that voodoo zombies exhibit thought, show emotion, feel pain, can communicate and recognize their surroundings, all traits which are found in the earliest zombie films. Voodoo zombies are in fact not monsters at all. They are victims of an outside party, someone who is controlling them for personal gain. (STOKES, 2010:10)

<h3>STOKES, ROMERO, NOTLD, CINEMA</h3>
The zombies in Romero’s diagetic world cannot be controlled, however, and there is little evidence of a transition from the zombie films even in the 1950s and The Night of the Living Dead. The two types of zombies are fundamentally different, and the leap from a creature enslaved to a creature completely independent is interesting at best, but not as helpful in understanding the allure of the undead. (STOKES, 2010:10)

<h3>STOKES, ZUMBI, MCINTOSH, KOVEN, HAITI, CINEMA</h3>
In his article, <b>“The Folklore of the Zombie Film” Mikel J. Koven</b> offers an interesting examination of the possible folkloric origins of the modern zombie, although he falls into a similar predicament as McIntosh by conflating the more European zombie of Romero’s design with the Haitian zombie. He even goes so far as to split his article into two different almost unrelated parts, talking first of the European-North American folkloric tradition of the reanimated corpse and then addressing the “ethnographic zombie” of the Haitian tradition. (STOKES, 2010:11)

<h3>STOKES, CINEMA, ZUMBI, ANTROPOCENO</h3>
Koven argues that this difference is accounted for in that “the modern cinematic zombie film has a more sociological purpose behind it: that the dead have come back to life for the sins of modernity” (24). (STOKES, 2010:11)

<h3>STOKES, ZUMBI, ANTROPOCENO</h3>
Although there is not often a specific plot-driving motive for the dead to walk again and avenge some wrong, there is always an underlying social or cultural problem being addressed in the film, a problem magnified and focused upon by the zombies and how people react to the zombie apocalypse. (STOKES, 2010:13)

<h3>STOKES, ROMERO, ZUMBI, GHOULS</h3>
Romero’s foundation for his work lies not only in previous “zombie” films, but rather in a rich American Gothic tradition, as well as a literary tradition that goes back to Dracula and Frankenstein. While I Am Legend is technically about vampires, the highly formulaic model of the zombie horror film is presented within the work.(STOKES, 2010:14)

<h3>STOKES, ROMERO, GÓTICO, MORTO-VIVO</h3>
Additionally, the legacy left by Edgar Allan Poe and H. P. Lovecraft is not lost on Romero. We find in Poe’s “Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar” the one of the first appearances of the “undead”, a man who is neither living nor dead, in American literature. In his iconic “The Fall of the House of Usher” Poe presents us with an ambiguous instance of the walking dead, one which resembles closely the conventions found in Romero’s oeuvre. (STOKES, 2010:15)

<h3>STOKES, ZUMBI, ROMERO, CANIBALISMO</h3>
 Secondly, zombies are “autonomous beings, not under the control of someone else” (3). This is an important distinction between the pre-Romero zombies and post-Romero zombies. This also is demonstrated within the works of Poe, Lovecraft and Matheson as the creatures are wholly autonomous and not under any kind of spell. The third important characteristic is the idea of progeneration: “After the initial cause, whatever it is, zombies rapidly increase their numbers by killing living people, who also become zombies…the zombies’ most preferred method of attack is to bite their victims” (4). The zombie apocalypse is so encompassing and dangerous because of this characteristic. Zombies are cannibals. They not only bite their victims, they “partially eat the living. (STOKES, 2010:16)

<h3>STOKES, SHAUNOTD, ZUMBI </h3>
We often find in zombie films, such as Shaun of the Dead, the problems normal people face in combating zombies, especially when their only weapon at hand may be a very ineffective firearm. (STOKES, 2010:17)

<h3>STOKES, DAWNOTD, ROMERO, SHOPPING</h3>
We find in the film a group of four people attempting to escape and finally hiding from the zombie invasion in a shopping mall. As the danger escalates the characters become more alienated from one another and the small society which they have created. Because of greed, selfishness, hatred, and an irrational attachment to “stuff”, the group dynamics become more fatal than the actual zombies. (STOKES, 2010:18)

<h3>STOKES, GROSS, ROMERO, NOTLD, DAWNOTD, ZUMBI</h3>
As <b>Louis Gross</b> describes, “Romero is about the process of removing the terror from the zombie and placing it on the authority figures with guns and machinery at their disposal” (87). In Night of the Living Dead our hero is shot and killed at the end of the film by a group of gun wielding men, a veritable mob sent out to kill and gather up the zombies. Although these men are supposed to represent protectors, they are portrayed as ignorant and power-hungry. Similarly in Dawn of the Dead “the small group battling the zombies consists of gun-crazy paranoiacs, who take real pride and pleasure in blowing the zombies apart” (Gross 87).(STOKES, 2010,19)

<h3>STOKES, ZUMBI, BAKHTIN, GROTESCO, MONSTRO</h3>
Zombies are inherently comedic and parodic while paradoxically they maintain their horrific state of monstrosity. In reference to Mikhail Bakhtin’s theory of the carnivalesque and grotesque realism, Linda Badley emphasizes, “the grotesque body is laughing, anarchic, joyously ambivalent, transgressing the modern canon that closes off and abjects: all is open, protruding, secreting, decomposing, eating and being eaten” (39). Zombies, especially those found in “Herbert West”, exemplify Bakhtin’s idea of grotesque realism as they transgress the most basic boundary between life and death. As zombies in general transgress thisboundary and create ridiculous laughter, death is faced and defeated by laughter.(STOKES, 2010:26)

<h3>STOKES, ZUMBI, HUMANIDADE</h3>
As parodies of human beings, zombies reveal the most base and terrifying aspects of humanity, yet they also expose the human body as ridiculous and absurd. According to <b>Linda Badley</b>, “even in otherwise bleak splatter epics such as Day of the Dead, they are ridiculous, disgusting, pathetic and absurd—at the same time and for the same reasons that they are horrifying” (35). (STOKES, 2010:26)(

<h3>STOKES, AUTÔMATO, CORPOS, OCIDENTE</h3>
 Herbert West’s corpses beating their “head against the wall of a padded cell,” acting “less like men than like unthinkable automata” and finally seeking out West and tearing him limb from limb are all extremely grotesque features. (STOKES, 2010:27)

<h3>STOKES, VAMPIROS, ZUMBIS, NOTLD</h3>
According to <b>Gregory Waller</b>, the zombie is a direct descendent of vampires and a member of the large family of the “undead.” Waller is one of the few zombie scholars who make the connection between zombies and vampires, between Bram Stoker’s Dracula and Romero’s Night of the Living Dead, and argues that Romero’s works are simply a continuation of the vampire myth. (STOKES, 2010:28)

<h3>STOKES, NOTLD, IAML, APOCALIPSE, </h3>
Although Night of the Living Dead is only one day in a world overrun by the living notlddead while I Am Legend takes place over several years, the basic premise remains the same. Night of the Living Dead simply takes the possible first moments of Matheson’s postapocalyptic world, the moments of the apocalypse, and shows how one man almost survived the onslaught of the undead, a man who would have become the Robert Neville figure if he had only the undead to contend with. But the lead character, Ben, was up against more than the living dead, he also had to face and overcome the living. If left to himself, like Robert Neville, Ben would likely have survived. (STOKES, 2010:29)
