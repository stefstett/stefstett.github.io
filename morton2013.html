             <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, PROPRIEDADES</h3>
            
           Hyperobjects have numerous properties in common. They are viscous,
which means that they “stick” to beings that are involved with them.
They are nonlocal; in other words, any “local manifestation” of a hyperobject is not directly the hyperobject.2 They involve profoundly different
temporalities than the human-scale ones we are used to. In particular,
some very large hyperobjects, such as planets, have genuinely Gaussian
temporality: they generate spacetime vortices, due to general relativity.
Hyperobjects occupy a high-dimensional phase space that results in
their being invisible to humans for stretches of time. And they exhibit
their effects interobjectively; that is, they can be detected in a space that
consists of interrelationships between aesthetic properties of objects. The hyperobject is not a function of our knowledge: it’s hyper relative to
worms, lemons, and ultraviolet rays, as well as humans (MORTON, 2013, p. 01)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, FIM DO MUNDO, NEGACIONISMO, AMBIENTALISMO APOCALÍPTICO</h3>
            
            Hyperobjects are directly responsible for what I call
the end of the world, rendering both denialism and apocalyptic environmentalism obsolete. Hyperobjects have already ushered in a new human
phase of hypocrisy, weakness, and lameness: these terms have a very specific resonance in this study, and I shall explore them in depth. Hypocrisy
results from the conditions of the impossibility of a metalanguage (and
as I shall explain, we are now freshly aware of these conditions because
of the ecological emergency); weakness from the gap between phenomenon and thing, which the hyperobject makes disturbingly visible; and
lameness from the fact that all entities are fragile (as a condition of possibility for their existence), and hyperobjects make this fragility conspicuous.3 Hyperobjects are also changing human art and experience (the
aesthetic dimension). We are now in what I call the Age of Asymmetry (MORTON, 2013, p. 02)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, OBJECT-ORIENTED ONTOLOGY</h3>
            
            Hyperobjects are not just collections, systems, or assemblages of other
objects. They are objects in their own right, objects in a special sense that
I shall elucidate as we proceed through this book. The special sense of
object derives from object-oriented ontology (OOO), an emerging philosophical movement committed to a unique form of realism and nonanthropocentric thinking (MORTON, 2013, p. 02)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, FILOSOFIA, METALINGUAGEM</h3>
            
            Hyperobjects thus present philosophy with a difficult, double task.
The first task is to abolish the idea of the possibility of a metalanguage
that could account for things while remaining uncontaminated by them (MORTON, 2013, p. 02)
            
            <h3>MORTON, GLOBALIZAÇÃO, METALINGUAGEM, METÁFORA, PÓS-MODERNISMO</h3>
            
             The globalizing sureness with which “there is no metalanguage” and
“everything is a metaphor” are spoken in postmodernism means that
postmodernism is nothing like what it takes itself to be, and is indeed
just another version of the (white, Western, male) historical project (MORTON, 2013, p. 04)
            
            <h3>MORTON, GRANDE ACELERAÇÃO </h3>
            
           After 1945 there began the Great Acceleration, in
which the geological transformation of Earth by humans increased by
vivid orders of magnitude (MORTON, 2013, p. 05)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HISTÓRIA, HUMANIDADE, ANTROPOCENO</h3>
            
            Or better: we are no longer able
to think history as exclusively human, for the very reason that we are
in the Anthropocene. A strange name indeed, since in this period nonhumans make decisive contact with humans, even the ones busy shoring
up differences between humans and the rest (MORTON, 2013, p. 05)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, STRANGE STRANGER</h3>
            
            Thus hyperobjects embody a truth about what I once thought
only applied to lifeforms, the truth of the strange stranger(MORTON, 2013, p. 06)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, FIM DO MUNDO, CONCEITO DE MUNDO</h3>
            
            Hyperobjects are what have brought about the end of the world.
Clearly, planet Earth has not exploded. But the concept world is no
longer operational, and hyperobjects are what brought about its demise.
The idea of the end of the world is very active in environmentalism (MORTON, 2013, p. 06)
            
            <h3>MORTON, FIM DO MUNDO, HISTORIOGRAFIA, MÁQUINA A VAPOR, BOMBA ATÔMICA</h3>
            
            The end of the world has already occurred. We can be uncannily precise about the date on which the world ended. Convenience is not readily associated with historiography, nor indeed with geological time. But
in this case, it is uncannily clear. It was April 1784, when James Watt
patented the steam engine, an act that commenced the depositing of carbon in Earth’s crust—namely, the inception of humanity as a geophysical
force on a planetary scale. Since for something to happen it often needs
to happen twice, the world also ended in 1945, in Trinity, New Mexico,
where the Manhattan Project tested the Gadget, the first of the atom
bombs, and later that year when two nuclear bombs were dropped on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki (Figure 2) (MORTON, 2013, p. 07)
            
            <h3>MORTON, FIM DO MUNDO, ANTROPOCENO, AQUECIMENTO GLOBAL</h3>
            
            The end of the world is correlated with the Anthropocene, its global
warming and subsequent drastic climate change, whose precise scope
remains uncertain while its reality is verified beyond question (MORTON, 2013, p. 07)
            
            <h3>MORTON, REALISMO ESPECULATIVO, CORRELACIONISMO, </h3>
            
            Speculative realism is the umbrella term for a
movement that comprises such scholars as Graham Harman, Jane Bennett, Quentin Meillassoux, Patricia Clough, Iain Hamilton Grant, Levi
Bryant, Ian Bogost, Steven Shaviro, Reza Negarestani, Ray Brassier, and
an emerging host of others such as Ben Woodard and Paul Ennis. All
are determined to break the spell that descended on philosophy since
the Romantic period. The spell is known as correlationism, the notion
that philosophy can only talk within a narrow bandwidth, restricted to
the human–world correlate: meaning is only possible between a human
mind and what it thinks, its “objects,” flimsy and tenuous as they are (MORTON, 2013, p. 08)
            
            <h3>MORTON, REALISMO ESPECULATIVO</h3>
            
            Speculative realism has a healthy impulse to break free of the correlationist circle, the small island of meaning to which philosophy has confined itself. It is as if, since the seventeenth century, thinking has been
cowed by science. Yet science not only cries out for “interpretation”—and
heaven knows some defenses of the humanities these days go as far as to
argue that science needs the humanities for PR purposes (MORTON, 2013, p. 10)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS </h3>
            
            It will become increasingly clear as this book proceeds that hyperobjects are not simply mental (or otherwise ideal) constructs, but are real
entities whose primordial reality is withdrawn from humans (MORTON, 2013, p. 15)
            
            <h3>MORTON, CLIMA, HIPEROBJETOS, </h3>
            
            So, let’s begin to think about hyperobjects in some depth. What is the
most striking thing about their appearance in the human world? Naturally humans have been aware of enormous entities—some real, some
imagined—for as long as they have existed. But this book is arguing that
there is something quite special about the recently discovered entities,
such as climate. These entities cause us to reflect on our very place on
Earth and in the cosmos. Perhaps this is the most fundamental issue—
hyperobjects seem to force something on us, something that affects some
core ideas of what it means to exist, what Earth is, what society is (MORTON, 2013, p. 15)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HYPEROBJETOS, DESLOCAMENTO DUPLO</h3>
            
            Hyperobjects, in effect, seem to push us
into a double displacement (MORTON, 2013, p. 17)
            
            <h3>MORTON, ANTROPOCENTRISMO</h3>
            
            No: we are not in the center of the universe, but we
are not in the VIP box beyond the edge, either. To say the least, this is a
profoundly disturbing realization (MORTON, 2013, p. 18)
            
             <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, ONTOTEOLOGIA</h3>
            
            Hyperobjects provoke irreductionist thinking, that is, they present us with scalar dilemmas in which
ontotheological statements about which thing is the most real (ecosystem, world, environment, or conversely, individual) become impossible (MORTON, 2013, p. 19)
            
             <h3>MORTON, ESCATOLOGIA, REVOLUÇÃO, HIPEROBJETOS, INDIVIDUALISMO, NACIONALISMO, CAPITALISMO</h3>
            
            We were perhaps expecting an eschatological solution from the sky, or a revolution in consciousness—or,
indeed, a people’s army seizing control of the state. What we got instead
came too soon for us to anticipate it. Hyperobjects have dispensed with
two hundred years of careful correlationist calibration. The panic and
denial and right-wing absurdity about global warming are understandable. Hyperobjects pose numerous threats to individualism, nationalism,
anti-intellectualism, racism, speciesism, anthropocentrism, you name it.
Possibly even capitalism itself (MORTON, 2013, p. 21)
            
             <h3>MORTON, HYPEROBJETOS </h3>
            
            I do not access hyperobjects across a distance, through some transparent
medium. Hyperobjects are here, right here in my social and experiential
space. Like faces pressed against a window, they leer at me menacingly:
their very nearness is what menaces (MORTON, 2013, p. 27)
            
             <h3>MORTON, UNCANNY </h3>
            
            While hyperobjects are near, they are also very uncanny (MORTON, 2013, p. 28)
            
             <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS</h3>
            
            The more I struggle to understand hyperobjects, the more I discover
that I am stuck to them. They are all over me. They are me (MORTON, 2013, p. 28)
            
             <h3>MORTON, TEMPO</h3>
            
            They are already here. I come across them later, I find myself poisoned
with them, I find my hair falling out. Like an evil character in a David
Lynch production, or a ghost in M. Knight Shyamalan’s The Sixth Sense,
hyperobjects haunt my social and psychic space with an always-already.
My normal sense of time as a container, or a racetrack, or a street, prevents me from noticing this always-already, from which time oozes and
flows, as I shall discuss in a later section (“Temporal Undulation”) (MORTON, 2013, p. 29)
            
             <h3>MORTON, SUJEITO, BACTERIA</h3>
            
            Every subject is formed at the expense of some viscous, slightly poisoned
substance, possibly teeming with bacteria, rank with stomach acid (MORTON, 2013, p. 31)
            
             <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS </h3>
            
            Like a nightmare that brings news of some
real psychic intensity, the shadow of the hyperobject announces the existence of the hyperobject (MORTON, 2013, p. 32)
            
             <h3>MORTON, OOO, VISCOSIDADE</h3>
            
            What
OOO asserts is that one can extend this insight to nonhuman entities. In
a sense, all objects are caught in the sticky goo of viscosity, because they
never ontologically exhaust one another even when they smack headlong into one another. A good example of viscosity would be radioactive
materials. The more you try to get rid of them, the more you realize you
can’t get rid of them. They seriously undermine the notion of “away.” Out
of sight is no longer out of mind, because if you bury them in Yucca
Mountain, you know that they will leach into the water table (MORTON, 2013, p. 36)
            
             <h3>MORTON, NÃO-LOCAL</h3>
            
            Hyperobjects are nonlocal (MORTON, 2013, p. 38)
            
             <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS</h3>
            
            Such a hyperobject would be massively distributed “in” time and space in the most
radical sense. Actually, “in” is not quite accurate. Since on this view time
and space are only emergent properties of objects larger than some thresh -
old size, the hypothetical subquantum hyperobject is “everywhere.” (MORTON, 2013, p. 45)
            
             <h3>MORTON, NÃO-LOCALIDADE</h3>
            
            Nonlocality is precisely a theory of textuality at the quantum level, in which information is dispersed among particles seemingly
occupying different regions of spacetime (MORTON, 2013, p. 46)
            
             <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, CONTRADIÇÃO</h3>
            
            Although this is not clear right now, by the end of this section it should become evident that hyperobjects are contradictory beasts (MORTON, 2013, p. 47)
            
             <h3>MORTON, NÃO-LOCALIDADE, ABSTRAÇÃO</h3>
            
            Nonlocality means just that—there is no such thing, at a deep level, as
the local. Locality is an abstraction. Metaphorically this applies to hyperobjects (MORTON, 2013, p. 47)
            
             <h3>MORTON, EVOLUÇÃO, PENSAMENTO ECOLÓGICO</h3>
            
            Stop the tape of evolution anywhere and you won’t see it. Stand under
a rain cloud and it’s not global warming you’ll feel. Cut your coat into
a thousand pieces—you won’t find capital in there. Now try pointing
to the unconscious. Did you catch it? Hyperobjects compel us to think
ecologically, and not the other way around (MORTON, 2013, p. 48)
            
             <h3>MORTON, MORTE, </h3>
            
            Or better, lifeforms both include and
exclude death, in the very same way that a poem is always talking about
the paper it is written on and never talking about it (MORTON, 2013, p. 52)
            
            <h3>MORTON, OBJETO</h3>
            
            When you approach an object, more and more objects emerge (MORTON, 2013, p. 55)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS</h3>
            
            The recognition of being caught in hyperobjects is precisely a feeling of
strange familiarity and familiar strangeness (MORTON, 2013, p. 55)
            
            <h3>MORTON, OOO, HIPEROBJETOS</h3>
            
            Harman writes that, because objects withdraw irreducibly, you can’t
even get closer to objects.4 This becomes clearer as we enter the ecological crisis—“Has it started yet? How far in are we?” This anxiety is a
symptom of the emergence of hyperobjects (MORTON, 2013, p. 56)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, FINITUDE</h3>
            
            But hyperobjects are not
forever. What they offer instead is very large finitude.8 I can think infinity. But I can’t count up to one hundred thousand. I have written one
hundred thousand words, in fits and starts. But one hundred thousand
years? It’s unimaginably vast. Yet there it is, staring me in the face, as the
hyperobject global warming (MORTON, 2013, p. 60)
            
            <h3>MORTON, MONSTRUOSIDADE</h3>
            
           The contemporary philosophical obsession with the monstrous provides a refreshing
exit from human-scale thoughts. It is extremely healthy to know not
only that there are monstrous beings, but that there are beings that are
not purely thinkable, whose being is not directly correlated with whatever thinking is (MORTON, 2013, p. 64)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, ESPAÇO, TEMPO</h3>
            
            Hyperobjects end the idea that time and space are empty containers
that entities sit in (MORTON, 2013, p. 65)
            
            <h3>MORTON, OBJETO, HIPEROBJETOS</h3>
            
            Like all objects, hyperobjects compel us to handle them in certain
ways (MORTON, 2013, p. 67)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, TRANSDIMENSIONAL, AQUECIMENTO GLOBAL</h3>
            
            Thinking hyperobjects as transdimensional real things is valuable.
Global warming is not simply a mathematical abstraction that doesn’t
really pertain to this world. Hyperobjects don’t inhabit some conceptual
beyond in our heads or out there. They are real objects that affect other
objects. Indeed the philosophical view behind thinking that objects are
one thing and relations (which is what we’re really talking about when
we talk about math or transcendence) are another positively inhibits our
transition to an ecological age, even as it poses sophisticated theories
of emergence or process (MORTON, 2013, p. 73)
            
            <h3>MORTON, SUBJETIVO, OBJETIVO</h3>
            
            The gaps I perceive between moments at which my mind is aware
of the hyperobject and moments at which it isn’t, do not inhere in the
hyperobject itself. This is not simply a matter of my “subjective” awareness versus an “objective” world (MORTON, 2013, p. 76)
            
            <h3>MORTON, FASEAMENTO, TRADUÇÃO</h3>
            
            Phasing happens because one object
translates another one (MORTON, 2013, p. 77)
            
            <h3>MORTON, FASEAMENTO</h3>
            
            Phasing is an indexical sign of an object that
is massively distributed in a phase space that is higher dimensional than
the equipment (our ears, the top of my head, a weather vane) used to
detect it (MORTON, 2013, p. 77)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, RUPTURA ONTOLÓGICA</h3>
            
            Hyperobjects are big enough relative
to us that they cause us to become aware of the rupture, which following
Heidegger I have begun to call the Rift. The Rift exists at an ontological
intersection, not a physical one. The intersection is between a thing and
its appearance-for another thing, or things. Thus, the mesh of relations
is on one side of the Rift, the hither side, while what I call the strange
stranger is on the yonder side—again, not spatially but ontologically (MORTON, 2013, p. 78)
            
            <h3>MORTON, ABISMO, OBJETO</h3>
            
            The abyss opens up in the interaction of any two or more objects.
Indeed, since objects are inherently inconsistent (a fact to which we shall
return), an abyss opens up simply because of the Rift, the fact that an
object can “interact with itself ” because it is a spacing and a timing,
not a given, objectified entity (MORTON, 2013, p. 79)
            
            <h3>MORTON, ENTIDADES, INTERCONEXÃO, INTEROBJETIVO</h3>
            
            We will find that all
entities whatsoever are interconnected in an interobjective system that
elsewhere I call the mesh (MORTON, 2013, p. 83)
            
            <h3>MORTON, SUJEITO, OBJETO</h3>
            
            On the view I expound here, by contrast, what
is called subject and what is called mind just are interobjective effects,
emergent properties of relationships between enmeshed objects (MORTON, 2013, p. 84)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS </h3>
            
            Now since hyperobjects are by definition the
largest, longest-lasting objects we know; and since they strafe and penetrate the physical body at every available opportunity, like some demonic
version of the Force (from Star Wars); is it not highly likely that the
way our minds are is to some extent, perhaps a large extent, influenced
by hyperobjects? So that when we think the hyperobject, we are in some
sense thinking the conditions of possibility for the human mind? That
thinking the hyperobject is thus thinking, in Marxist terms, the base of
the mind, and not simply the (ideological, cultural) superstructure? (MORTON, 2013, p. 85)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, CAUSALIDADE</h3>
            
            There is something even more startling about the footprints of hyperobjects. These footprints are signs of causality, and of here is both subjective and objective genitive. Causality and the aesthetic, the realm of signs
and significance and sensation, are one and the same. Hyperobjects are
so big that they compel us toward this counterintuitive view. Interobjectivity eliminates the difference between cause and sign. Let’s pause and
consider just how remarkable this is (MORTON, 2013, p. 88)
            
            <h3>MORTON, CAUSALIDADE, APARÊNCIA ESTÉTICA</h3>
            
            There is no difference between causality and aesthetic
appearance (aisthēsis) (MORTON, 2013, p. 91)
            
            <h3>MORTON, FUTURALIDADE</h3>
            
            Futurality is reinscribed into the present, ending the metaphysics of
presence: not through some neat philosophical footwork, but because
the very large finitude of hyperobjects forces humans to coexist with a
strange future, a future “without us.” (Recall that plutonium and global
warming have amortization rates of 24,100 and 100,000 years respectively.) (MORTON, 2013, p. 94)
            
            <h3>MORTON, OBJETIFICAÇÃO, HIPEROBJETOS</h3>
            
            World as the background of
events is an objectification of a hyperobject: the biosphere, climate, evolution, capitalism (yes, perhaps economic relations compose hyperobjects) (MORTON, 2013, p. 100)
            
            <h3>MORTON, NATUREZA</h3>
            
            In a word, the notion that we are living “in” a world—one that we can call Nature—no longer applies in any
meaningful sense, except as nostalgia or in the temporarily useful local
language of pleas and petitions. We don’t want a certain species to be
farmed to extinction, so we use the language of Nature to convince a legislative body. We have a general feeling of ennui and malaise and create
nostalgic visions of hobbit-like worlds to inhabit. These syndromes have
been going on now since the Industrial Revolution began to take effect (MORTON, 2013, p. 101)
            
            <h3>MORTON, AQUECIMENTO GLOBAL, NÃO-LOCALIDADE</h3>
            
            Now what happens when global warming enters the scene? The background ceases to be a background, because we have started to observe it.
Strange weather patterns and carbon emissions caused scientists to start
monitoring things that at first only appeared locally significant. That’s
the old definition of climate: there’s the climate in Peru, the climate on
Long Island, and so on. But climate in general, climate as the totality
of derivatives of weather events—in much the same way as inertia is a derivative of velocity—is a beast newly recognized via the collaboration
of weather, scientists, satellites, government agencies, and other entities (MORTON, 2013, p. 102-103)
            
            <h3>MORTON, AQUECIMENTO GLOBAL, FIM DO MUNDO</h3>
            
            The spooky thing is, we discover global warming precisely when it’s
already here. It is like realizing that for some time you had been conducting your business in the expanding sphere of a slow-motion nuclear
bomb. You have a few seconds for amazement as the fantasy that you
inhabited a neat, seamless little world melts away. All those apocalyptic
narratives of doom about the “end of the world” are, from this point of
view, part of the problem, not part of the solution (MORTON, 2013, p. 104)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HUMANO, MUNDO, OOO</h3>
            
            Human beings lack a world for a very good reason: because no
entity at all has a world, or as Harman puts it, “There is no such thing as
a ‘horizon.’”11 The “world” as the significant totality of what is the case is
strictly unimaginable, and for a good reason: it doesn’t exist (MORTON, 2013, p. 108)
            
            <h3>MORTON, MUNDO, FIM DO MUNDO </h3>
            
            What is left if we aren’t the world? Intimacy. We have lost the world but
gained a soul—the entities that coexist with us obtrude on our awareness
with greater and greater urgency. Three cheers for the so-called end
of the world, then, since this moment is the beginning of history, the end
of the human dream that reality is significant for them alone. We now
have the prospect of forging new alliances between humans and nonhumans alike, now that we have stepped out of the cocoon of world (MORTON, 2013, p. 108)
            
            <h3>MORTON, CAPITALISMO, PARADOXO</h3>
            
            Capital must keep on producing more of itself in order to continue to be
itself. This strange paradox is fundamentally, structurally imbalanced.
Consider the most basic process of capitalism: the turning of raw materials into products. Now for a capitalist, the raw materials are not strictly
natural. They simply exist prior to whatever labor process the capitalist
is going to exert on them. Surely here we see the problem. Whatever
exists prior to the specific labor process is a lump that only achieves definition as valuable product once the labor has been exerted on it (MORTON, 2013, p. 111)
            
            <h3>MORTON, CAPITALISMO, HIPEROBJETO, MODERNO, ONTOLOGIA POLÍTICA</h3>
            
            One part of capital, itself a hyperobject, is its relentless revolutionizing of its mode of production. But the other part is tremendous
inertia. And the tremendous inertia happens to be on the side of the
modern. That is, the political ontology in which there is an “away.” But
there is no “away” in the time of hyperobjects (MORTON, 2013, p. 112)
            
            <h3>MORTON, MODERNIDADE, INTRUMENTALISMO</h3>
            
            Societies embody philosophies. What we have in modernity is considerably worse than just instrumentality (MORTON, 2013, p. 114)
            
            <h3>MORTON, PARADOXO, CAPITALISMO, IDEALISMO, ANTROPOCENTRISMO, OBJETOS, VINGANÇA</h3>
            
            Paradoxically, capitalism has unleashed myriad objects upon us, in their manifold horror and sparkling splendor.
Two hundred years of idealism, two hundred years of seeing humans at
the center of existence, and now the objects take revenge, terrifyingly
huge, ancient, long-lived, threateningly minute, invading every cell in
our body (MORTON, 2013, p. 115)
            
            <h3>MORTON, OBJETO, UNCANNY</h3>
            
            Objects are unique. Objects
can’t be reduced to smaller objects or dissolved upward into larger ones.
Objects are withdrawn from one another and from themselves. Objects
are Tardis-like, larger on the inside than they are on the outside. Objects
are uncanny. Objects compose an untotalizable nonwhole set that defies
holism and reductionism (MORTON, 2013, p. 116 )
            
            <h3>MORTON, BOTH/AND, EITHER/OR</h3>
            
            g. It sounds like good value to have “both–and” rather than
“either–or,” to our somewhat consumerist minds (“buy one get one free”) (MORTON, 2013, p. 117)
            
            <h3>MORTON, OBJETO, ENTIDADE</h3>
            
            Commercial break: If you’re having trouble with “object” at this
point, why not try another term, such as “entity”? (MORTON, 2013, p. 117)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, TERRA, AQUECIMENTO GLOBAL, EVOLUÇÃO</h3>
            
            The time of hyperobjects is the time during which we discover ourselves on the inside of some big objects (bigger than us, that is): Earth,
global warming, evolution. Again, that’s what the eco in ecology originally means: oikos, home (MORTON, 2013, p. 118)
            
            <h3>MORTON, FIM DO MUNDO</h3>
            
            The end of the world is not a sudden punctuation point, but rather it is a matter of deep time. Twenty-four thousand
years into the future, no one will be meaningfully related to me. Yet
everything will be influenced by the tiniest decisions I make right now (MORTON, 2013, p. 122)
            
            <h3>MORTON, MUNDO, NATUREZA, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            Without a world, there is no Nature. Without a world, there is no life.
What exists outside the charmed circles of Nature and life is a charnel
ground, a place of life and death, of death-in-life and life-in-death, an
undead place of zombies, viroids, junk DNA, ghosts, silicates, cyanide,
radiation, demonic forces, and pollution (MORTON, 2013, p. 126)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS</h3>
            
            The historic moment at which hyperobjects become visible by humans
has arrived. This visibility changes everything. Humans enter a new age
of sincerity, which contains an intrinsic irony that is beyond the aestheticized, slightly plastic irony of the postmodern age (MORTON, 2013, p. 128)
            
            <h3>MORTON, STRANGE STRANGER </h3>
            
            But the mouse is a non-mouse, or what I call a strange stranger (MORTON, 2013, p. 129)
            
            <h3>MORTON, TEMPO, HIPEROBJETOS</h3>
            
            As we enter
the time of hyperobjects, Nature disappears and all the modern certainties that seemed to accompany it. What remains is a vastly more complex
situation that is uncanny and intimate at the same time (MORTON, 2013, p. 130)
            
            <h3>MORTON, NÃO-HUMANO</h3>
            
            Nonhuman entities emerge through our mapping,
then they destroy them (MORTON, 2013, p. 130)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HYPEROBJETOS</h3>
            
            Hyperobjects are messages in bottles from the
future: they do not quite exist in a present, since they scoop the standard
reference points from the idea of present time. In order to cope with
them, we require theories of ethics that are based on scales and scopes
that hugely transcend normative self-interest theories, even when we
modify self-interest by many orders of magnitude to include several generations down the line or all existing lifeforms on Earth (MORTON, 2013, p. 138)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, INTIMIDADE, MORTE</h3>
            
            Hyperobjects force us into an intimacy with our
own death (because they are toxic), with others (because everyone is
affected by them), and with the future (because they are massively distributed in time) (MORTON, 2013, p. 139)
            
            <h3>MORTON, SIMBIOSE, ECOLOGIA, INTIMIDADE</h3>
            
            Consider symbiosis, as explored by Lynn Margulis and others. One
feature of symbiosis is endosymbiosis, the fact that lifeforms do not simply live alongside us: they are within us, so much so that on many levels
the host–parasite distinction collapses. Our mitochondria are symbionts
hiding from their own catastrophe, the environmental disaster called
oxygen. Many cell walls are double, hinting at some ancient symbiotic
coupling. To a great extent others are us: or as the poet Rimbaud put
it, “Je est un autre.”9 On a nonphenomenological level (that is, one not
dependent on experience), a level an extraterrestrial with a microscope
could validate, we are strangers to ourselves. That is how close the other
is. Ecology is about intimacy (MORTON, 2013, p. 139)
            
            <h3>MORTON, TECNOLOGIA, HIPEROBJETOS</h3>
            
            The fact that we need devices such as computers and Geiger counters to see hyperobjects, objects that will define our future, is humbling
in the same way Copernicus and Galileo brought humans down to Earth
by insisting that the universe was not rotating around us.12 In their era,
“common sense” told people that the sun revolved around the earth once
a day. Common sense also assured people that weird old ladies who
proffered herbal remedies and failed to drown when thrown in water
should be burnt, because they were witches. Common sense has a lot
to answer for (MORTON, 2013, p. 140)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, ZONA, OBJETO</h3>
            
            Hyperobjects are simply so large
and so long lasting that the zones that cascade from them are rich and
intense enough for us to become aware of them; and to become aware of
the irreducible gap between zone and object, which Kant calls the gap
between the phenomenon and thing (MORTON, 2013, p. 143)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, APOCALÍPTICO</h3>
            
            Hyperobjects are genuinely apocalyptic (from the Greek term apocaluptō) in the sense that they lift the veil of prejudice—but in so doing
they do not catapult us into a beyond. Rather they fix us more firmly to
the spot, which is no longer an embeddedness in a world (MORTON, 2013, p. 144)
            
            <h3>MORTON, ZONAS, METAFÍSICA DA PRESENÇA</h3>
            
            Zones are real but they are not objectively “there,” since that would
mean that they were metaphysically present, and the hyperobject poses
a serious and physical challenge to the metaphysics of presence (MORTON, 2013, p. 146)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, FIM DO MUNDO</h3>
            
            Hyperobjects end the world, and they end the transcendental a priori
that jumps out of the world to decide its reality. They do so not by dint
of clever arguments, nor by remaining mute and impenetrable. There is
a rhetorical mode of hyperobjects, since all objects are a form of delivery,
as we shall see. Hyperobjects don’t smack us upside the head or hit us
like Doctor Johnson’s boot, refuting Berkeley with the nonargument of
an aggressive kick. They are not prereflective, if by that we mean they
supply some immediate hotline to truth. Indeed, if the rhetorical delivery has a name, it would need to include something like an inducement
to reflection (MORTON, 2013, p. 147)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, DESTINO, MORTE</h3>
            
            The hyperobject is indeed the bringer of fate, destiny, death.
This destiny comes from beyond the (human) world, and pronounces or
decrees the end of the world. This decree marks a decisive pivot in Earth
history in which humans discern the nonhuman and thus reckon the
fate of Earth with a greater justice (MORTON, 2013, p. 148)
            
            <h3>MORTON, NATUREZA, MATÉRIA</h3>
            
            I’m starting to think that this
thing called “matter” is like the thing called Nature or the thing called
Santa Claus—you have to say you believe in it so as not to upset the
kids (MORTON, 2013, p. 150)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, HIPOCRISIA</h3>
            
            Hyperobjects simply allow us to see this intrinsic, ontological level of hypocrisy,
because they are just so much larger in scale than we are, both temporally and spatially. We see signs everywhere, but not the hyperobject as
such. We see signs of doom, but the doom is nowhere objectively present. How easy it is for denialism to work its magic on Americans who are
both very insecure and very nihilistic (MORTON, 2013, p. 152)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, SOMBRAS</h3>
            
            We
see the shadows of the hyperobject, gigantic patches of darkness that
fleetingly slide across the landscape. We see shadows of humans engraved
on a Japanese wall. We see rain clouds, mushroom clouds, we see the
Oort Cloud at the edge of the Solar System. “The awful shadow of some
unseen power.”44 We see figments and fragments of doom (MORTON, 2013, p. 153)
            
            <h3>MORTON, OOO</h3>
            
            It is fairly easy to discern how refusing to see the big picture is a form
of what Harman calls undermining.50 Undermining is when things are
reduced to smaller things that are held to be more real. The classic form
of undermining in contemporary capitalism is individualism: “There
are only individuals and collective decisions are ipso facto false.” But this
is a problem that the left, and environmentalism more generally, recognize well (MORTON, 2013, p. 156)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, ERA DA ASSIMETRIA, RADIAÇÃO, AQUECIMENTO GLOBAL</h3>
            
            Hyperobjects have dragged
humans kicking and screaming (when they feel anything at all, rather
than being merely blank with denial) into an Age of Asymmetry in which
our cognitive powers become self-defeating. The more we know about
radiation, global warming, and the other massive objects that show up
on our radar, the more enmeshed in them we realize we are (MORTON, 2013, p. 160)
            
            <h3>MORTON, MODERNIDADE, OBJETO, UNCANNY, ZUMBIS, FIM DO MUNDO</h3>
            
            Flying
through the universe in the space shuttle of modernity, we find out that
we were driving with the breaks on, revving the engines while the fuselage lies rusting in a junkyard. We have woken up inside an object, like
a movie about being buried alive. It is now the uncanny time of zombies after the end of the world, a time of hypocrisy where every decision
is “wrong (MORTON, 2013, p. 160)
            
            <h3>MORTON, LIBERTAÇÃO, TERROR </h3>
            
            Should we feel terrified or liberated? Both (MORTON, 2013, p. 160)
            
            <h3>MORTON, NÃO-HUMANO, ESPAÇO</h3>
            
            In this period, humans recognize the infinite
depths of their inner space for the first time. It becomes radically impossible to embody this inner space in any nonhuman entity (MORTON, 2013, p. 162)
            
            <h3>MORTON, ANTROPOCENO, HUMANO, CONDUTOR</h3>
            
            Yet what has happened so far during the epoch of the Anthropocene
has been the gradual realization by humans that they are not running
the show, at the very moment of their most powerful technical mastery
on a planetary scale. Humans are not the conductors of meaning, not the
pianists of the real: a truth that is common both to poststructuralist and
to speculative realist thought, despite their stated differences (MORTON, 2013, p. 164)
            
            <h3>MORTON, NÃO-HUMANO, ERA DA ASSIMETRIA </h3>
            
            The nonhuman, already right here in social space, is finally acknowledged in the Age of Asymmetry. The nonhuman is no longer simply
an object of knowledge (calculable and predictable), but is known by
humans as a being in its own right, through a tricky ruse of reason itself,
which now knows too much about nonhumans (MORTON, 2013, p. 171)
            
            <h3>MORTON, ERA DA ASSIMETRIA, ENTENDIMENTO, HUMANO, NÃO-HUMANO, ANTROPOCENO, GRANDE ACELERAÇÃO</h3>
            
            It’s called the Age of Asymmetry because within human understanding humans and nonhumans
face one another equally matched. But this equality is not like the Classical phase. There is no Goldilocks feeling in the Great Acceleration era
of the Anthropocene. The feeling is rather of the nonhuman out of control, withdrawn from total human access. We have even stopped calling nonhumans “materials.” We know very well that they are not just
materials-for (human production). We have stopped calling humans
Spirit. Sure, humans have infinite inner space. But so do nonhumans (MORTON, 2013, p. 172)
            
            <h3>MORTON, IRONIA</h3>
            
            Irony multiplies
everywhere, since no being’s appearance fully exhausts its essence. Irony
becomes the experience of total sincerity, of being Jonah in the whale
realizing that he is part of the whale’s digestive system, or Han Solo and
Leia inside the gigantic worm they think is the surface of an asteroid (MORTON, 2013, p. 173)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, ERA DA ASSIMETRIA</h3>
            
            It is hyperobjects whose presence guarantees that we are in the
next moment of history, the Age of Asymmetry. With their towering
temporality, their phasing in and out of human time and space, their
massive distribution, their viscosity, the way they include thousands of
other beings, hyperobjects vividly demonstrate how things do not coincide with their appearance (MORTON, 2013, p. 174)
            
            <h3>MORTON, OBJETO, ESTRANHO</h3>
            
             The more we know about an object, the stranger it becomes.
Conversely, the more we know about an object, the more we realize that
what call subject is not a special thing different from what we call object (MORTON, 2013, p. 175)
            
            <h3>MORTON, VIDA, NÃO-VIDA, MORTO-VIVO</h3>
            
            Life is made of non-life, so that replicant molecules such as DNA, RNA,
and some silicates are neither alive nor non-alive, but rather they are
more like the undead, persisting ironically by reproducing themselves in
the very attempt to erase their disequilibrium (MORTON, 2013, p. 175)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPOCRISIA, FRAQUEZA, MODERNIDADE</h3>
            
            In the previous section, we saw that the time of hyperobjects is an age
of a precisely defined hypocrisy. Now we shall add to the (truly) postmodern human portfolio another specific category: weakness. Weakness
determines the capacity for tuning. Just as hypocrisy flies in the face of
a Nietzschean tendency within modernity, so weakness ends the search
for ultimate men and supermen. Modernity is like the dinosaur, rendered
extinct by some planet-scale cataclysm. Small, weak mammals crawled
out from the wreckage (MORTON, 2013, p. 176)
            
            <h3>MORTON, CATÁSTROFE, INÍCIO</h3>
            
            The very feeling of wondering whether the catastrophe will
begin soon is a symptom of its already having begun. Besides, hyperobjects are too viscous, too nonlocal and molten, too interobejctive to
be specified in the way we commonly think objects should be pinned
down (MORTON, 2013, p. 177)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, FRAQUEZA</h3>
            
            Hyperobjects only make clear what is already the case: humans are
weak, since they sincerely tune to the entities that crowd around them,
unable to bootstrap themselves into the geostationary orbit of metalanguage (MORTON, 2013, p. 179)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, CONHECIMENTO</h3>
            
            The more data we have about hyperobjects the less we
know about them—the more we realize we can never truly know them (MORTON, 2013, p. 180)
            
            <h3>MORTON, NATUREZA, HIPEROBJETOS, VISCOSIDADE</h3>
            
            So the curious phenomenon arises in which
Nature dissolves just as hyperobjects start to ooze uncannily around
us. “Objects in mirror are closer than they appear.” Viscosity is what
compels us, what puts us in the zone of the imperative (Lingis’s term).
In this zone, choice is not the protocol of moral action. The viscosity of
hyperobjects haunts us. It looms into our social, psychic, and ecological
space. Or rather, we discover that it was already looming (MORTON, 2013, p. 181)
            
            <h3>MORTON, NEGACIONISMO, LUTO, ANTROPOCENO</h3>
            
            The trouble with the PR approach, or the reason-only approach (its
twin in some ways), is that human beings are currently in the denial
phase of grief regarding their role in the Anthropocene (MORTON, 2013, p. 183)
            
            <h3>MORTON, RESTAURAÇÃO, RAZÃO ANTROPOCÊNICA</h3>
            
            The calls for a restoration of a balance that
never existed on Earth—Earth being the name for a text of geotrauma—
are desperate attempts to put the genie back in the bottle; or rather the
twin genies of Anthropocenic reason and Anthropocenic human force (MORTON, 2013, p. 194)
            
            <h3>MORTON, ANTROPOCENO, COLAPSO, </h3>
            
            Reality in the Anthropocene is becoming more vivid and “unreal,” spectral. Without a world, without Nature, nonhumans crowd into human
space, leering like faces in a James Ensor painting or the faces of Butoh
dancers. The difference between a face and a mask (in the Greek, prosō -
pon) collapses. Without presence, habitual, ontically given coordinates
of meaningfulness dissolve. This irreducible unreality is a symptom of reality as such with which the weird realisms (speculative realism,
object-oriented ontology) are beginning to cope as emergent features of
the uncanny intersection of geotrauma and human history (MORTON, 2013, p. 194-195)
            
            <h3>MORTON, OBJETO, APARÊNCIA </h3>
            
            The fundamental reason for lameness
has to do with a special property of any given entity that is particularly
visible in the case of hyperobjects. An object fails to coincide with its
appearance-for another object, no matter how accurate that appearancefor. There is thus a lameness within every object, a lameness that constitutes the very being of the object as such. In order to exist, an object must
fail to coincide with itself totally (MORTON, 2013, p. 196)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HUMANO, HIPEROBJETO, FISSURA</h3>
            
            The lameness applies to humans, who now stand within the resonance of hyperobjects. There is a fissure between how we appear and
what we are, a fissure this study has called the Rift. The “inner space” that
Kant and others opened up in the Romantic period is only a distant
and inverted caricature of the Rift, like a photographic negative. The Rift
guarantees that inner space, no matter how deep or vivid or sensitively
attuned, is hermetically sealed from other entities (MORTON, 2013, p. 196)
            
            <h3>MORTON, AQUECIMENTO GLOBAL, ZUMBIS</h3>
            
            In no sense
then should art be PR for climate change. Have you ever considered the
possibility of doing PR for a relentless army of zombies? (MORTON, 2013, p. 196)
            
            <h3>MORTON, PENSAMENTO, NÃO-HUMANO, CONTEMPLAÇÃO</h3>
            
            Thinking is already, in itself,
a relation to the nonhuman, insofar as the logical content of one’s
thought is independent of the mind thinking it.61 In this sense thinking is intrinsically contemplative (MORTON, 2013, p. 198)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, NÃO-HUMANO</h3>
            
            What have we witnessed in this book? Radiation, hydrocarbons,
global warming, and a number of other hyperobjects. Along with them,
we have seen the emerging reactions to hyperobjects as genuine nonhuman entities that are not simply products of a human gaze. Hyperobjects are not just the stuff of charts and simulations, but rather are a
huge objects consisting of other objects: global warming comprises the
sun, the biosphere, fossil fuels, cars, and so on (MORTON, 2013, p. 199)
            
            <h3>MORTON, NÃO-HUMANO, HISTÓRIA, PENSAMENTO, PÓS-HUMANO</h3>
            
            Nonhuman beings are responsible for the next moment of human history and thinking. It is not simply
that humans became aware of nonhumans, or that they decided to ennoble some of them by granting them a higher status—or cut themselves
down by taking away the status of the human. These so-called posthuman games are nowhere near posthuman enough to cope with the time
of hyperobjects (MORTON, 2013, p. 201)
