<h3>FAGAN, FUTURO, AMBIENTAL</h3>

Contemporary representations of environmental futures often feature disastrous, apocalyptic
and catastrophic scenarios, particularly in film and popular culture.1 One site in
which this representation is prominent is in the climate change debate, where such narratives
in relation to the environment can be found not only in popular culture but also in
governmental statements (Brown, 2009; Huhne, 2011; King, 2004; Obama, 2010; Stern,
2006) and academic literature produced by Politics and International Relations (IR;
Caney, 2010; Dobson, 1999; Gardiner, 2009; Garvey, 2013; Hiskes, 2005; Page, 2007). (FAGAN, 2017, p. 225)

<h3>FAGAN, ÉTICA</h3>

One response to this perceived inertia, among activists, politicians and liberal political
theorists, is to turn to ethics to provide a motivational ‘push’, which obligates
engagement with what might otherwise be thought of as temporally and spatially distant
consequences of climate change, and which proposes the means and method of
such engagement (Caney, 2006; Jamieson, 2001; Skrimshire, 2010). (FAGAN, 2017, p. 226)

<h3>FAGAN, LITERATURA, ÉTICA</h3>

The literature which engages
explicitly with questions of ethics and climate change does not address the effects of the
assumptions found in apocalyptic scenarios in framing or limiting treatment of this question
(Caney, 2006; Dobson, 1999; Gardiner, 2009; Garvey, 2008; Page, 2007) (FAGAN, 2017, p. 226)

<h3>FAGAN, </h3>

The article offers a conceptually driven analysis that, rather than developing ‘better’
ethical principles to ‘solve’ the problem of climate change, seeks to problematise the
treatment of ethics as offering a progressive or alternative route to engaging with the
threat of ecological apocalypse, and thereby to repoliticise the use of ethics in this debate. (FAGAN, 2017, p. 227)

<h3>FAGAN, IMAGINÁRIO APOCALÍPTICO </h3>

Under the shadow of the apocalyptic imaginary, the ethical subject of
climate change is reproduced as non-relational in both spatial and temporal terms: as a
self-contained, self-interested, autonomous and sovereign individual. Drawing on
resources in post-foundational and relational thought, I argue that configuring the ethical
subject in this way makes responsive engagement with any order outside of the one
which might be argued to have caused the ecological crisis in the first place, and with
any other from whom ethical obligations might originate, very difficult (FAGAN, 2017, p. 227)

<h3>FAGAN, NARRATIVA, FUTURO ECOLÓGICO, DEBATE CLIMÁTICO</h3>

The article first identifies and illustrates a narrative of disastrous ecological futures
that can be found in current climate change debate. Such a framing is often explicitly
designed to promote action on climate matters, but—as I will show below—there is a
perception that it has failed to generate the right kind of action (FAGAN, 2017, p. 227)

<h3>FAGAN, URGÊNCIA TEMPORAL</h3>

Kate Manzo (2012) has shown how a sense of temporal urgency is pervasive in media
coverage of climate change—Google alone, she reports, provided ‘about 74,400,000
results’ when the phrase ‘time is running out on climate change’ was entered into the
search engine in May 2012 (FAGAN, 2017, p. 228)

<h3>FAGAN, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA</h3>

In the context of
climate change, the ethics/apocalypse intertext matters because such overlap can be
seen in assumptions about the nature of the ethical subject, the temporal and spatial
contours of the relation between self and other, and the possibilities for political community.
This intertext is produced both explicitly and more implicitly, as the following
sections go on to demonstrate (FAGAN, 2017, p. 230)

<h3>FAGAN, ÉTICA, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA, APOCALIPSE</h3>

Orienting the production of the ethics of climate change from these various sites is a gesture
towards the apocalyptic. The particular claims about disaster, time, urgency, politics,
nature and civilisation invoked here owe much to, and are unified by, a specific type of
apocalyptic logic. The ecological crisis as rendered here is produced in terms of apokalupsis,
or revelation (FAGAN, 2017, p. 231)

<h3>FAGAN, TEMPO, APOCALIPSE</h3>

Apocalyptic treatments of time are characterised by the idea that time is directed
towards a certain event (Methmann and Rothe, 2010) and that the apocalyptic era will see
a period of accelerating development towards this end, or ‘time compression’ (Heyward
and Rayner, 2016). More specifically, the apocalypse is linked to an idea of messianic
time: an understanding of history as progressing time that will come to definitive end
(Hoelzl, 2010: 98). This accelerated time is characterised by an outbreak of lawlessness
prior to the revelation—the overcoming of ‘ambiguity, error and dispersal of sense’
(Colebrook, 2012: 204). The claims in ecological disaster narratives, that ‘time is running
out’, that we are approaching a ‘tipping point’ and that we must ‘act now’, invoke precisely
this sense of acceleration, time compression and urgency (FAGAN, 2017, p. 231)

<h3>FAGAN, FUTURO, APOCALIPSE, TEMPO</h3>

First, the messianic as the vision of an absolute future casting its apocalyptic
shadow over present time and, second, the foregrounding of technical foresight,
anticipation, or representation, and the image of the present absorbing all futurity into
itself. We might think of these as two orientations towards the end of history: understood
as bounding the traditional time in-between in which politics and history is possible, a
time which is oriented always towards its end (Hoelzl, 2010: 103), or as the end of this
very possibility of history, an escape from the time in-between to what Dillon (2015) has
called the modern vision of an ‘infinity of finite things’ (FAGAN, 2017, p. 232)

<h3>FAGAN, CATÁSTROFE, FUTURO, CRISE CLIMÁTICA</h3>

The future catastrophe of which they warn is
neither redemptive nor destructive of the present; it does not give meaning or direction to
present time. It is rather an extension of the present: a future envisioned as revelatory of
the truths already inherent in the modern conception of the subject, nature and community.
These truths are arguably the very ones that have led to the climate crisis in the first
place, and so their reinscription in the climate disaster narrative offers rather limited
resources for inspiring or motivating alternatives. It is not only that the ecological apocalypse
is ‘banal’ in the sense that it is ubiquitous (De Goede and Randalls, 2009) but also
in the sense that it is not apocalyptic enough, that it does not offer an ending (FAGAN, 2017, p. 323)

<h3>FAGAN, FUTURO, PROJEÇÕES</h3>

Rather than a future
that is destructive of the present (Colebrook, 2012), that future is instead occupied by the
projection of the present and so is not futural at all. The ecological apocalypse future
reveals only what we already know: those cognitive commitments to which we are most
deeply attached (FAGAN, 2017, p. 232)

<h3>FAGAN, ÉTICA, CONSUMO </h3>

This same assumption about the non-relational subject can be seen in claims that ethics
is needed to motivate people to act. That is, such claims rely on the idea that either there
is something inherently individualistic and self-interested about human nature or that we
have been ‘led astray’ (by consumer culture, capitalism or variants on these) such that we
have become produced as individualistic/self-interested. Ultimately, both starting points
lead to similar conclusions—that ethics is needed either to modify and civilise our barbaric
tendencies or to overcome the influence of those forces which produce us as selfinterested.
The assumption is that we start off as not in relation and not responsible—with
or for one another, future generations, or the natural world—and that we need ethics in
order to produce a sense of relation and so responsibility (FAGAN, 2017, p. 233)

<h3>FAGAN, ÉTICA, PRINCÍPIO, FUTURO,</h3>

The dominant approach is one which treats ethics as principles which might then
be extendable to the future, or principles which are derived from engaging with scenarios
about the future in order to ‘test’ their scope and limits, extending existing moral theory
and the options it offers outwards, as in considerations of the non-identity problem,
(Parfit, 2010). We can see the pairing of this approach to ethics with the apocalyptic narrative
in claims about ethical action and time compression, and the exhortation to be
attentive to the ethical demands of future generations as outlined above (FAGAN, 2017, p. 235)

<h3>FAGAN, FUTURO, APOCALIPSE ECOLÓGICO, ÉTICA</h3>

Relation then is not (or not only) about what we do now having an impact on the
future. Rather, understandings of the present and of the range of possible ethical practices
are informed both by accounts of subjectivity put forward in the future scenarios and also
by the form of the future imaginary itself. If, in the case of ecological apocalypse, the
apocalyptic imaginary does not offer a sense of discontinuity, then the imagination of the
future which informs the articulation of the ethical subject is not really futural at all. This
means that to try to think about ethical relation stretched across time becomes very difficult (FAGAN, 2017, p. 236)

<h3>FAGAN, ÉTICA MOTIVACIONAL</h3>

More broadly, the ‘motivational ethics’ identified above—an ethics which is tied to a
particular notion of the future—entails that the solutions and impetus provided by that
ethics only makes sense in relation to that particular future. For such approaches to make
sense, we must retain the ‘forward’ momentum of the very modernist project that has
arguably brought us to this point in the first place. That momentum is, however, as I have
argued, not really futural at all, but an extension of the present (FAGAN, 2017, p. 237)

<h3>FAGAN, ÉTICA-ORIENTADA-PARA-O-FUTURO</h3>

These limitations are, however, the result of a very specific reading of future-oriented
ethics, which is produced by the reduction of that future to the order of the same (FAGAN, 2017, p. 238)

<h3>FAGAN, ALTERIDADE</h3>

Affirming the alterity of the future changes our ethics and politics in the present on
a more fundamental level (FAGAN, 2017, p. 238)

<h3>FAGAN, ÉTICA, APOCALIPSE</h3>

I have sought to problematise the idea that ethics—when it is structured by a particular
apocalyptic logic—offers an alternative or solution to the lack of action on climate
change. Despite their desire to motivate action or change thinking on climate change, the interplay of apocalyptic and ethical motivation discourses instead contributes to the production
of the problem to which they seek to respond. This cultural production of ethics
is one mechanism through which the depoliticising effects of apocalyptic imaginaries is
operationalised. It is a particularly insidious one in this context because claims about the
ethics of climate change are often positioned as offering the means to critique dominant
framings of the issue. (FAGAN, 2017, p. 239-240)
