            <h3>MORTON, ZIZEK, POLÍTICA, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            Slavoj Zizek derives his signature concept from this zombified version of political reason: "they know very well what they are doing, but still, they are doing it" (<i>Sublime Object</i> 29). In this regard the cynicism present in zombie texts touches on an important political question: what does it mean to have a politics after a better, more reasonable world no longer retains credibility? This problem in turn concerns the existential contours of a world that is consensually shaped for a zombielike aimlesness in which <i>they know very well that they're becoming more and more like zombies, but still they are doing it</i> (MORTON, 2014, p. 316)
            
            <h3>MORTON, AGAMBEN, ZOE, BIOS, VIDA, ZUMBI </h3>
            
            At the beginning of his seminal work, <i>Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life</i> (1998), Giorgio Agamben, the contemporary Italian philosopher, invokes two definitions of life: "<i>zoe</i> which expressed the simple fact of living common to all living beings (animals, men, or gods), and <i>bios</i>, which indicated the form or way a living proper to an individual or group" (9). Just as there can be no single term for life, there is seemingly no single term to express what we mean now by the word <i>zombie</i> (MORTON, 2014, p. 316-317)
            
            <h3>MORTON, BIOPOLÍTICA, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            This chapter not only draws on the theoretical concept of biopolitics to help shed light on fictions about the walking dead, but it also follows the zombie turn into the discursive field of biopolitics to show how biopolitics and zombie theory might be productively intertwined (MORTON, 2014, p. 317)
            
            <h3>MORTON, BIOPOLÍTICA, VIDA, MORTE, AGAMBEN, TANATOPOLÍTICA</h3>
            
            Situating biopolitics at the limit of life and death, Agamben defines the conceptual ground rules for undead political theory. He forces a field-defining question at the heart of all biopolitical and zombie thought today - namely, is every kind of biopolitics necessarily thanatopolitics? (MORTON, 2014, p. 318-319)
            
            <h3>MORTON, VIDA</h3>
            
            But the reason we attack "life" is the reason we attack any formation of "truth": it marks the possibility for experience in the world and designates a limited possibility for political and aesthetic imagination. Beyond that, though, there is an even greater project: an ontology without metaphysics; in other words, an understanding of being and experience without recourse to a substrate such as "life", "science", or "truth" - that is, life made bare from the ideology of life (MORTON, 2014, p. 320)
            
            <h3>MORTON, ZUMBI, VÍRUS, BIOPOLÍTICA, DERRIDA, AUTOIMUNIDADE</h3>
            
            The much observed resemblance between zombies and viruses conceals a similar biopolitical thesis. In zombie texts, transmission and continuation are contained within - even as they violently oppose - human life. Zombies thus signal not viralism as much as the constitutive death/life structure of autoimmunism; in a classically Derridean fashion, they designate autoimmunity for death from life and vice-versa (MORTON, 2014, p. 322)
            
            <h3>MORTON, ROMERO, NOTLD, BEN, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            Romero puts this point in an all to obviously tragic light at the end of <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>: Ben's greatest enemy was never the zombies; rather, it was the white posse commanding sovereign power that can't distinguish him from a zombie in the end (MORTON, 2014, p. 322)
            
            <h3>MORTON, BIOPODER, ZUMBI, IMUNIDADE</h3>
            
            In an era where all strategies of resistance to the forces of biopower and technologies of the self appear to be foreclosed from the outset, the zombie text offers what appears to be an ultimately conservative fantasy: a small community of survivors can barricade themselves from the onslaught of the population and remain safe, for a time, in a protected space of domesticity. The politics of zombie worlds are foremost biopolitical in the way they address the need for a community to form and create a zone of immunitary protection: boarding up the house or shopping mall from any potential threat (MORTON, 2014, p. 324)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HUMANIDADE, TWD </h3>
            
            The zombie is increasingly used as a tabula rasa for understanding human behavior (the laboratory scenes in <i>Day of the Dead</i> or the second and third seasons of <i>The Walking Dead</i>, for example), while humans constantly resort to barbarism when faced with the breakdown of political order (MORTON, 2014, p. 324)
            
            <h3>MORTON, AUTOIMUNIDADE, ZUMBI, HUMANIDADE, TRANSMISSÃO</h3>
            
            Thus, in order to clarify the autoimmunitary paradigm that connects zombies and humans, it is important to trace the ways that both autoimmunity and zombies rely on forms and strategies of transmission (MORTON, 2014, p. 324)
            
            <h3>MORTON, ZUMBI, TWD, ROMERO </h3>
            
            The zombie, according to Rick Grimes, is the final destination of us all - both the living and the dead. Romero's rules applY. That's the secret: everyone who dies, whatever the cause, comes back as a zombie. Instead of platitudes, Rick offers a powerful paradigm for zombie studies, a force field for rethinking the ontological difference between the human and the nonhuman other (MORTON, 2014, p. 325)
            
            <h3>MORTON, BIOPOLÍTICA, MONSTRUOSIDADE, COLETIVIDADE, MODERNO</h3>
            
            To be fair, the zombie necessarily organizes a biopolitical horror, an image of out-of-control population rendered in a monstrous form. It pressures the constitutive structure of life and makes visible its own horde as an emblem of modernity and a sire of strategic thinking about the administration of life. In other words, it makes life/non-life its theme, rewriting the term through which something like life or politics can be thought or talked about (MORTON, 2014, p. 326)
            
            <h3>MORTON, VIDA, MORTE, BIOPOLÍTICA, TANATOPOLÍTICA </h3>
            
            Thinking life or death - thinking biopolitics and thanatopolitics - would appear irrevocably fated to become a discourse of banal truims or life philosophies (MORTON, 2014, p. 327)
            
            <h3>MORTON, ZUMBI, AGAMBEN, VIDA, BIOS, ZOE, VIDA NUA</h3>
            
            To be sure, the theoretical limit most often deployed for thinking about the zombie is Agamben's division of life into bios and zoe. This division explains why and how the zombie lends itself so readily to allegorical thinking about the dialectics of the privileged and the marginalized. The zombie, of course, supplies a version of "bare life" that usefully illustrates a series of problems that emerge when life is classified into structured taxonomies about the proper and improper (MORTON, 2014, p. 327)
            
            <h3>MORTON, DIFERENCIAÇÃO </h3>
            
            The all-too-neat human/zombie split, reproducing the division between proper and improper life, doesn't hold. Again, "We are all infected" (MORTON, 2014, p. 327)
            
            <h3>MORTON, APOCALIPSE, DERRIDA, POLÍTICA</h3>
            
            Neither apocalyptic nor postapocalyptic, the zombie text goes beyond and before such temporal schema and looks more like what Derrida has described as a "politics to come". For Derrida, this notion of politics "would be more in line with what lets singular beings (anyone) 'live together', there where they are not yet deined by citizenship, that is, by their condition as lawful 'subjects' in a state or legitimate members of a nation-state or even of a confederation or world state... It does require another thought and another putting into practice of the concept of the 'political' and the concept 'world'" (Derrida <i>et al.</i> 130-31) (MORTON, 2014, p. 328-329)
            
            <h3>MORTON, APOCALIPSE, ZUMBI, CORPO, DERRIDA, BIOPOLÍTICA</h3>
            
            Despite the radical and apocalyptic valences of zombie films, the rise of the zombie body is not an event in the properly Derridean sense of the term, because its operations are always already co-inscribed within the experience of the survivors themselves. As a paradigm for biopolitical thinking, then, the zombie speaks to a kind of radical porosity, where the inside is always radically exposed to and indeed indistinguishable from the outside (MORTON, 2014, p. 329)
            
            <h3>MORTON, AUTOIMUNIDADE, HUMANIDADE, ZUMBI </h3>
            
            The key tension for this autoimmune structure exists between a notion of a properly human and natural community and a kind of vital technicity, epitomized by the zombie, that tends to destroy as it preserves the former. "Becoming zombie" consequently seems less about freedom/autonomy than about rethinking the paradigm of life around issues of technology and community (MORTON, 2014, p. 329)
            
            <h3>MORTON, ZUMBI, DERRIDA, COLETIVIDADE</h3>
            
            This temporal structure allows the zombie to be thought of in relation to Derrida's event "to come". The zombie horde as an immanent and radical modulation of inhuman swarm life portends the absolute end moment of a certain structure of temporality inaugurated through the generation of the community. The swarm as decentralized chaos is not only a reconfiguration of communal organization, for it is itself already inscribed in the community through a system of transmission, technology, and death - in short, they are forced to act in the service of the thing their community attempts to exterminate (MORTON, 2014, p. 330)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HUMANIDADE, ZUMBI, IMUNIZAÇÃO,</h3>
            
            Human and zombie exist on a continuum organized by different degrees of immunization that always eventuate into a momento of autoimmunity - necessary insofar as every act of immunization necessarily risks misrecognizing itself as the threat that needs to be exterminated. From the position of the zombie, the human threat is immunized by consumption and transformation; from the position of the human survivor, the zombie threat is immunized by killing zombies or retreating behind barriers (MORTON, 2014, p. 330-331)
            
            <h3>MORTON, ZUMBI, VIDA, IMUNIZAÇÃO, AUTOIMUNIDADE, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO</h3>
            
            Thus, instead of thinking of zombies throughh the valence of a proper form of life, this system of immunization always produces an autoimmunitary valence where zombies are not merely a form of human life turned against itself, but rather a formation of transmission, tele-technicity, decentralized control, and flesh turned against itself. In the name of survival of the community, the humans are forced to participate in their own form of zombification vis-à-vis this logic of transmission, technicity, and death (MORTON, 2014, p. 331)
            
            <h3>MORTON, AUTOIMUNIDADE, DIALÉTICA, DERRIDA</h3>
            
            The zombie as autoimmunization escapes the binarism between human/zombie, life/death, bios/techné and imagines instead a different sort of conceptual apparatus. This autoimmunitary valence finds its form in Derrida's rendition of autoimmunization as a machinic function that opens a community up to a new possible energies and dynamics (MORTON, 2014, p. 331)
            
            <h3>MORTON, ZUMBI, BIOPOLÍTICA, AUTOIMUNIDADE</h3>
            
            Zombie biopolitics shot through with an autoimmunitary logic exposes the zombie to a discourse where life, health, and the community are not understood as ultimate values, but rather as concepts that are presupposed with a sense within a mechanistic vitality that imbues them with a specter of death and transmission (MORTON, 2014, p. 332)
            
            <h3>MORTON, ESPOSITO, COLETIVIDADE, IMUNIDADE</h3>
            
            If flesh, for Esposito, marks a threshold of nonidentity that is simultaneously "the way of being in common of that which seeks to be immune" (121), its entropic physical drift echoes that forming and reforming zombie horde, which incorporates without digesting. The zombie horde remakes the tension between flesh and bodies: what it consumes is also what resists incorporation into its body, and thus it always risks its own expulsion (MORTON, 2014, p. 335)
            
            <h3>MORTON, REPETIÇÃO, DERRIDA, BIOPOLÍTICA, IMUNIZAÇÃO</h3>
            
            The zombie produces repetition without a difference, materializing Derrida's horizonal limit of messianism that biopolitical thought seeks to overcome by negotiating the transformation of bios into Thanatos. While Esposito uses flesh to weave the immunitary logic into a shared desire for immunization, the flesh of zombies attunes this idiom more precisely to a thematic of transmission and exposure (MORTON, 2014, p. 336)
            
            <h3>MORTON, HÄGGLUND, DERRIDA, AUTOIMUNIDADE</h3>
            
            According to Hägglund's reading of salvation and survival in Derrida: "We must therefore distinguish between salvation as immortality and salvation as survival. The religious idea of salvation as absolute immunity is necessarily an idea of immortality, since every mortal being is autoimmune" (<i>Radical Atheism</i> 130)
