            <h3>SEABROOK, HAITI, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            As Polynice talked on, I reflected that these tales ran closely parallel not only with those of the negroes in Georgia and the Carolinas, but with the mediaeval folklore of white Europe. Werewolves, vampires, and demons were certainly no novelty. But I recalled one creature I had been hearing about in Haiti, which sounded exclusively local - the <i>zombie</i> (SEABROOK, 2016, p. 93)
            
            <h3>SEABROOK, CORPO, ALMA</h3>
            
            The <i>zombie</i>, they say, is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but taken from the grave and endowed by sorcery with a mechanical semblance of life - it is a dead body which is made to walk and act and move as if it were alive (SEABROOK, 2016, p. 93)
            
            <h3>SEABROOK, POLYNICE, SUPERSTIÇÃO</h3>
            
            "Superstition? But I assure you that this of which you now speak is not a matter of superstition. Alas, these things - and other evil practices connected with the dead - exist. They exist to an extent that you whites do not dream of, though evidences are everywhere under your eyes (SEABROOK, 2016, p. 94)
            
            <h3>SEABROOK, ZUMBI, MONOCULTURAS</h3>
            
            "No, my friend, no, no. There are only too many true cases. At this very moment, in the moonlight, there are <i>zombies</i> working on this island, less than two hours' ride from my own habitation [...] If you ride with me tomorrow night, yes, I will show you dead men working in the cane fields. Close even to the cities, there are sometimes <i>zombies</i> Perhaps you have already heard of those that were at Hasco..." (SEABROOK, 2016, p. 94-95)
            
            <h3>SEABROOK, HASCO</h3>
            
            "What about Hasco?" I interrupted him, for in the whole of Haiti, Hasco is perhaps the last name anybody would think of connecting with either sorcery or superstition (SEABROOK, 2016, p. 95)
            
            <h3>SEABROOK, HASCO, MODERNO</h3>
            
            It stands for the Haitian-American Sugar Company - an immense factory plant, dominated by a huge chimney, with clanging machinery, steam whistles, freight cars. It is like a chunk of Hoboken. It lies in the eastern suburbs of Port-au-Prince, and beyond it stretch the cane fields of the Cul-de-Sal. Hasco makes rum when the sugar market is off, pays low wages, twenty or thirty cents a day, and gives steady work. It is modern big business, and it sounds it, looks it, smells it (SEABROOK, 2016, p. 95)
            
            <h3>SEABROOK, ZUMBIS, ANEDOTA</h3>
            
            The spring of 1918 was a big cane season, and the factory, which had its own plantations, offered a bonus on the wages of new workers. [...] One morning an old black headman, Ti Joseph of Colombier, appeared leading a band of ragged creatures who shuffled along behind him, staring dumbly, like people walking in a daze. [...] Joseph said they were ignorant people from the slopes of Morne-au-Diable, a roadless mountain district near the Dominican border, and that they did not understand the creole of the plants. [...]Each saturday afternoon, Joseph went to collect the wages for them all, and what division he made was no concern of Hasco, so long as the work went forward. [...]  Croyance [n.a. a esposa de Joseph], in her bright kerchief, leading the nine dead men and women behind her, past the railroad crossing, where she murmured a prayer to Legba, past the great white-painted wooden Christ, who hung life-sized in the glaring sun, where she stopped to kneel and cross herself - but the poor <i>zombies</i> prayed neither to Papa Legba, nor to Brother Jesus, for they were dead bodies walking, without souls or minds. [...] As Croyance sat with her savory dried herring and biscuit baked with salt and soda, and provision of <i>clairin</i> in the tin cup by her side, she pitied the <i>zombies</i> who had worked so faithfully for Joseph in the cane fields, and who now had nothing, while all the other groups around were feasting, and as she pitied them, a woman passed, crying [...] And Croyance thought, "These <i>tablettes</i> are not salted or seasoned, they are sweet, and cna do no harm to the <i>zombies</i> just this once". [...] But the baker of the <i>tablettes</i> had salted the <i>pistache</i> nuts before stirring them into the <i>rapadou</i>, and as the <i>zombies</i> tasted the salt, they knew that they were dead and made a dreadful outcry and arose and turned their faces toward the mountain. [...] But the <i>zombies</i> shuffled through the market-place, recognizing neither father nor wife nor mother, and as they turned leftward up the path leading to the graveyard, a woman whose daughter was in the procession of the dead threw herself screaming before the girl's shuffling feet and begged her to stay; but the grave-cold feet of the daughter and the feet of the other dead shuffled over her and onward; and as they approached the graveyard, they began to shuffle faster and rushed among the graves, and each before his own empty grave began clawing at the stones and earth to enter it again; and as their cold hands touched the earth of their own graves, they fell and lay there, rotting carrion (SEABROOK, 2016, p. 95-99)
            
            <h3>SEABROOK, WALKING DEAD MEN</h3>
            
            Before finally taking leave of La Gonave, I did see these "walking dead men", and I did, in a sense, believe in them and pitied them, indeed, from the bottom of my heart (SEABROOK, 2016, p. 100)
            
            <h3>SEABROOK, ZUMBIS</h3>
            
            My first impression of the three supposed <i>zombies</i>, who continued dumbly at work, was that there was something about them unnatural and strange. They were plodding like brutes, like automatons (SEABROOK, 2016, p. 101)
            
            <h3>SEABROOK, ZUMBIS, OLHOS </h3>
            
            The eyes were the worst. It was not my imagination. They were in truth like the eyes of a dead man, not bling, but staring, unfocused, unseeing. The whole face, for that matter, was bad enough. It was vacant, as if there was nothing behind it. It seemed not only expressionless, but incapable of expression (SEABROOK, 2016, p. 101)
            
            <h3>SEABROOK, SUPERSTIÇÃO</h3>
            
            But it is a fixed rule of reasoning in America that we will never accept the possibility of a thing's being 'supernatural' so long as any natural explanation, even farfetched, seems adequate (SEABROOK, 2016, p. 102)
            
            <h3>SEABROOK, HAITI, SUPERSTIÇÃO</h3>
            
            In all Haiti, there is no clearer scientifically trained mind, no sounder pragmatic rationalist, than Dr. Antoine Villiers. [...] he said: "My dear sir, I do not believe in miracles nor in supernatural events, and I do not want to shock your Anglo-Saxon intelligence, but this Polynice of yours, with all his superstition, may have been closer to the partial truth than you were. Understand me clearly. I do not believe that one one has ever been raised literally from the dead - neither Lazarus, nor the daughter of Jairus, nor Jesus Christ himself - yet I am not sure, paradoxical as it may sound, that there is not something frightful, something in the nature of criminal sorcery if you like, in some cases at least, in the matter of <i>zombies</i>. (SEABROOK, 2016, p. 103)
            
            <h3>SEABROOK, CÓDIGO PENAL, HAITI</h3>
            
            <i>Article</i> 249. Also shall be qualified as attempted murder the employment which may be made against any person of substances which, without causing actual death, produce a lethargic coma more or less prolonged. If, after the administering of such substances, the person has been buried, the act shall be considered murder no matter what result follows (SEABROOK, 2016, p. 103)   .
