<h3>MILLS, BATTERMAN, FIELD, SIMBIOSE, FUNGO</h3>

Plants play a key role in the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, phosphorus and
oxygen, and this role is amplified by symbiosis with fungi (figure 2). In exchange
for photosynthetically fixed carbon, mycorrhizal fungi provide plants with mineral nutrients that would be otherwise inaccessible [17]. Plant tissue contributes a
net carbon sink when organic matter is buried in sediments, and burial of this
reduced organic carbon results in a net source of O2 to the atmosphere,
which has been the major mechanism of oxygen production over Earth history [18] (MILLS, BATTERMAN & FIELD, 2017, p. 01)

<h3>MILLS, BATTERMAN, FIELD, AMBIENTE, PALEOZOICO</h3>

Multiple proxies indicate that the global environment
underwent major changes during the Palaeozoic phase of
plant colonization, which supports a link between terrestrialization of plants and biogeochemical cycling (figure 1). Global
biogeochemical models that link plants, carbon cycling and climate, although uncertain, generally predict a decline in CO2
concentrations over the Palaeozoic Era, coincident with the
development of the terrestrial biosphere [1–3,19 (MILLS, BATTERMAN & FIELD, 2017, p. 02)

<h3>MILLS, BATTERMAN, FIELD, ESTRUTURA FÚNGICA</h3>

These fungal structures bear strong structural homology to the mycorrhizal and
mycorrhiza-like associations formed between modern-day
land plants and Glomeromycotina fungi [13]. This type of
fungal associate is found in more than 85% of land plants
today [33], spanning the land plant phylogeny (figure 1a).(MILLS, BATTERMAN & FIELD, 2017, p. 03)

<h3>MILLS, BATTERMAN, FIELD, SIMBIOSE, FUNGO, PLANTAS</h3>

Recent evidence indicates that the Glomeromycotina were
not the only fungus to form symbioses with plants at the
first stages of land plant evolution. The earliest diverging liverworts, the Haplomitriopsida, form associations with fungi
of a clade that is thought to have diverged earlier than
the Glomeromycotina—the Mucoromycotina [35]. Since this
discovery, experiments have revealed that, like the Glomeromycotina, the liverwort–Mucoromycotina associations are
nutritionally mutualistic [36] and that the associations are present in taxa throughout the land plant phylogeny [37–40].
Re-examination of Rhynie chert fossils has revealed that early
Rhyniophytes (Horneophyton, Nothia) were frequently colonized
by at least two fungal endophytes bearing morphological
characteristics similar to those of modern Glomeromycotina
and Mucoromycotina fungal associations in extant plants, indicating that both fungal symbionts may have been present
during initial plant terrestrialization [41,42]. It has since been
shown that such dual, nutritionally mutualistic colonizations
are also common throughout the plant kingdom [37,43].(MILLS, BATTERMAN & FIELD, 2017, p. 03)

<h3>MILLS, BATTERMAN, FIELD, FUNGO, SIMBIOSE, </h3>

Given the significance of the role of symbiotic soil fungi in
modern terrestrial phosphorus cycling, it is likely that the evolution of plant–fungal symbioses was critical for acquisition of
nutrients by the burgeoning land flora. This means that plant–
fungal symbioses may therefore have helped to drive a shift
from marine to terrestrial productivity and a corresponding
increase in the global rate of organic carbon burial. (MILLS, BATTERMAN & FIELD, 2017, p. 03)

<h3>MILLS, BATTERMAN, FIELD, CLIMA, PALEOZOICO</h3>

Further uncertainty remains regarding the productivity of
the early terrestrial biosphere, and the effects of early plants on
the global carbon cycle and climate. This topic has been the
focus of considerable debate in the literature, which has recently
turned to the question of the ability of early terrestrial plants to
enhance silicate weathering rates and liberate phosphorus
[3,22,23]. Our findings indicate that, in addition to these considerations, the nature of the supply of phosphorus to plants from
fungal partners can contribute significantly to thewider environmental changes that occurred during the Palaeozoic (figure 5). (MILLS, BATTERMAN & FIELD, 2017, p. 06)

<h3>MILLS, BATTERMAN, FIELD, PALEOZOICO, GLACIAÇÃO</h3>

These scenarios show entirely different drivers for Palaeozoic environmental change, with the latter implying that
the early terrestrial biosphere may not have been responsible
for either glaciation or substantial O2 rise. (MILLS, BATTERMAN & FIELD, 2017, p. 06)

<h3>MILLS, BATTERMAN, FIELD, FUNGO, SIMBIOSE, ASSOCIAÇÃO</h3>

It is likely that the earliest land plants were cosmopolitan in
their choice of fungal symbionts [44], because different fungi
may have provided multiple, additional and non-nutritional,
benefits. These benefits are likely to have included enhanced
access to water and resistance to disease and/or herbivores,
as is the case with their extant relatives [48,49]. It seems
probable that plants would have associated with a variety
of—and potentially a multitude of—partners at different
stages of their evolution and spread. Therefore, the relative
dominance of Glomeromycotina or Mucoromycotina fungi
within early plant assemblages may have been transient
according to climate and/or ecology (MILLS, BATTERMAN & FIELD, 2017, p. 06)

<h3>MILLS, BATTERMAN, FIELD, BIOSFERA, TRANSIÇÃO CLIMÁTICA, PALEOZOICO</h3>

The global terrestrial biosphere response to high CO2 depends
greatly on the functioning of plant– fungal symbioses and
phosphorus cycling. The experiments of Field et al. [36,43]
show that these responses are not straightforward. Efforts to
understand the plant-driven Palaeozoic climate transition
using models would benefit from the inclusion of a mechanistic
representation of plant– fungal phosphorus and carbon
exchange that is formulated from empirical data, and the
resulting predictions should be independently tested against
geochemical data. Our initial effort to incorporate fungal phosphorus uptake into an existing biogeochemical model is based
on limited experimental results and extrapolation to large
spatial and temporal scales, which is necessarily a first step
that must be improved upon. Nevertheless, we show that the
effect on the modelled climate transition may be highly significant, and reliant upon the nutritional nature of the relationship
between plants and symbiotic fungi. Our findings raise questions about current reconstructions of plant-driven changes
to climate during the Palaeozoic, and show that understanding
the mechanisms of global plant phosphorus uptake, rather
than just the liberation of phosphorus during continental weathering, is essential for resolving past climatic and
environmental changes throughout the Earth’s history (MILLS, BATTERMAN & FIELD, 2017, p. 07)
