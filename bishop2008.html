    <h2>BISHOP, 2008</h2>
    
<h3>FICÇÃO, MONSTRO, BISHOP</h3>
With the popular success of the first talkie horror films, Hollywood of the 1930s was anxious to find the next big-screen monster. (BISHOP, 2008:141)

<h3>BISHOP, SEABROOK, VOODOO, ZUMBI, MORTO-VIVO</h3>
According to Seabrook and other ethnographers, powerful voodoo priests, commanding the knowledge of African mysticism and ritual, were able to kill their enemies and bring them back from the dead as mindless servants. This violation of the taboos of death peaked people’s interest in a previously unknown horror: the zombie. (BISHOP, 2008:141)

<h3>BISHOP, WHITE ZOMBIE, HAITI, IMPERIALISMO</h3>
Victor Halperin’s White Zombie. Based on the stylistic model of Tod Browning’s Dracula (1931), this movie presents audiences with the exoticism of the Caribbean, the fear of domination and subversion, and the perpetuation of the imperialist model of cultural and racial hegemony. (BISHOP, 2008:141)

<h3>BISHOP, HEGEL, DIALÉTICA, VOODOO</h3>
In fact, the film emulates the sociopolitical theories and criticisms of Aime´ Cesaire, Frantz Fanon, and Edward Said, emphasizing a type of Hegelian master/slave dialectic as well as the dominance of one culture (embodied in the voodoo master) over another (that of the zombie slaves). (BISHOP, 2008:141)

<h3>BISHOP, SUB-SUBALTERNO, ZUMBI, FALA</h3>
In this light, the film may also be critiqued as cultural discourse through the theoretical lens of Gayatri Spivak, for the new ‘‘sub-subaltern’’ class of the zombie is literally silent, enslaved, and unable to connect with the dominant culture through any liminal space of discourse. (BISHOP, 2008:141)

<h3>BISHOP, AMEAÇA, ZUMBI, TRANSFORMAÇÃO, COLONIALISMO, VOODOO</h3>
For a western white audience, the real threat and source of terror in these films are not the political vagaries of a postcolonial nation or the plights of the enslaved native zombies, but rather the risk that the white protagonists might become zombies themselves. In other words, the true horror in these movies lies in the prospect of a westerner becoming dominated, subjugated, and effectively ‘‘colonized’’ by a native pagan. This new fear—one larger than merely death itself— allowed the voodoo zombie to challenge the pantheon of cinematic monsters from Europe, becoming the first thoroughly postcolonial creature from the New World to appear in popular horror movies. (BISHOP, 2008:141-142)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, MONSTRO, HAITI</h3>
As I have discussed at length elsewhere (Bishop 2006), the zombie is a unique Hollywood monster inasmuch as it originated in the folkloric and ritual practices of the New World, specifically in the Republic of Haiti. (BISHOP, 2008:142)

<h3>BISHOP, COLONIALISMO, HAITI, VOODOO</h3>
As a former colonial establishment, Haiti is a complex land of synthesis and hybridity, a liminal space where western Christianity fused (albeit irregularly) with ancient African ritual and mysticism. The resulting religious system came to be known in the West as voodoo, a much maligned and misunderstood set of beliefs and rituals that deal directly with death and the spirit world. (BISHOP, 2008:142)

<h3>BISHOP, HAITI, ESCRAVO, COLONIALISMO </h3> 
Haiti, the second oldest independent nation in the western hemisphere, has a complex and violent history, founded primarily on the mixing of slaves with diverse African cultural origins withEuropean imperialists and Christians. Haiti became a French colony in 1697, and because of a constant influx of new labor from Africa, slaves far outnumbered the French settlers by the end of the eighteenth century. A revolt was almost inevitable, and the fight for Haitian independence officially began with a solemnly performed voodoo ceremony on the night of August 14, 1791 (Dayan 29). Over ten years of brutal violence followed, and finally, in 1804, Haiti became the ‘‘only locale in history for a successful slave revolution,’’ resulting in the first ‘‘Black Republic’’ (Dayan 3) (BISHOP, 2008:142)

<h3>BISHOP, COLONIALISMO, VOODOO, ZUMBI</h3>
A direct result of the limited US occupation was increased western awareness of and increased curiosity and fascination with voodoo rituals and zombie practices. (BISHOP, 2008:142)

<h3>BISHOP, VOODOO, HAITI, ESCRAVO</h3>
Voodoo quickly became an important part of daily life in Haiti, and after the revolution against the French ended in 1804, the religion was allowed to grow and develop more freely without constant influence from colonial Catholic priests (Metraux 40). Métraux emphasizes that most importantly, voodoo gave hope to the Haitians— first to the slaves, and later to the poor (qtd. In Mintz 5). (BISHOP:2008:143)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI</h3>
Of greater interest to the narratological investigation of the zombie itself is Rhodes’s etymological tracking of the term zombie. The first recorded use of the word in print appeared as early as 1792 in a text by Frenchman Moreau de Saint-Méry, where he defines it as a ‘‘Creole word that means spirit, revenant’’ (qtd. in Rhodes 75). (BISHOP, 2008:143)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, MORTO-VIVO, HAITI</h3>
It was not until 1912 that the word zombie became associated with the living dead; an essay by Judge Henry Austin in New England Magazine refers to a Haitian poison that causes a comatose state in a victim that could be mistaken for death (Rhodes 75). Also in 1912, Stephen Bonsal published The American Mediterranean, which documents the account of a Haitian man who was found tied to a tree days after his confirmed death and burial (Rhodes 76). (BISHOP, 2008:143)

<h3>BISHOP, SEABROOK, HAITI, VOODOO, ZUMBI</h3>
 After a journalistic trip in 1924 to Arabia, Seabrook decided to travel to Haiti to perform a first-hand anthropological investigation into voodooism. He learned Haitian Creole and even lived with a native ‘‘sorceress’’ named Maman Ce´lie, attempting to immerse himself fully in the local culture (Rhodes 79). Seabrook was exposed to the creation of ouanga charms, potions, and powders, and he took active part in a number of authentic voodoo ceremonies and rituals, culminating in his direct exposure to real zombies. (BISHOP, 2008:143)

<h3>BISHOP, SEABROOK, AUTÔMATO, MORTE</h3>
In The Magic Island, he describes these creatures as dumb workers, ‘‘plodding like brutes, like automatons… The eyes were the worst… They were in truth like the eyes of a dead man, not blind, but staring, unfocused, unseeing’’ (Seabrook 101). (BISHOP, 2008:143)

<h3>BISHOP, SEABROOK, MORTO-VIVO</h3>
The American public, however, was probably less interested in the science and more in the spectacle, and Seabrook’s book became a huge success, forever establishing the idea of the ‘‘living dead’’ in the imaginations of the West. (BISHOP, 2008:144)

<h3>BISHOP, WHITE ZOMBIE</h3>
According to Rhodes, the general structure of Halperin’s film comes from fairy tales and Tod Browning’s Dracula; Rhodes presents a detailed comparison of the plot of White Zombie with that of Dracula to show how ‘‘its use of travel to a foreign land, its treatment of the hero and heroine, [and] its inclusion of a wise elder’’ parallel the earlier film precisely (21). (BISHOP, 2008:144)

<h3>BISHOP, SEABROOK, WHITE ZOMBIE, ZUMBI</h3>
White Zombie features the virtually unknown zombie creature from Seabrook’s accounts, but because the details of the creature’s construction were unknown (or at least undocumented) at the time, Halperin and Weston drew on the concept of hypnotism and mesmerism featured in Du Maurier’s novel. (BISHOP, 2008: 144)

<h3>BISHOP, MONSTRO, VOODOO, ZUMBI</h3>
In addition to the central monster’s originality, the popularity and success of the voodoo zombie movie can be largely linked to its inherent exoticism. Western people, particularly at the turn of the century, were becoming acquainted with and fascinated by primitive cultures. (BISHOP, 2008:144)

<h3>BISHOP, BERLINER, HAITI, ESCAPISMO</h3>
Berliner pursues the reasons behind this interest in the exotic in his 2002 book Ambivalent Desire. Although he focuses his study on the French obsession with Africa in the 1920s, his understanding of exoticism clearly applies to Americans’ perspective vis-a`-vis the Haitian people in the 1930s. Berliner links exoticism with escapism, defining the exotic as being ‘‘constructed as a distant, picturesque other that evokes feelings, emotions, and ideals in the self that have been considered lost in the civilizing process’’. (BISHOP, 2008:144)

<h3>BISHOP, ESCAPISMO</h3>
On a basic level, intellectual westerners wanted an escape from their own hectic ‘‘modern’’ lives and looked to native cultures to recapture the simplicities of the past. (BISHOP, 2008:144)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, COLONIALISMO</h3>
The tone and style of most early zombie movies echo the Gothic stylization of films such as Dracula and Frankenstein—yet their tales are much closer to home. Although the action takes place in the Caribbean rather than on US soil, the films are certainly more a part of the New World than those set in Romania or Eastern Europe. (BISHOP, 2008:144)

<h3>BISHOP, FICÇÃO, ZUMBI, ROMERO</h3>
Yet zombie movies invariably function as horror-inducing narratives because of the presence of the zombies themselves. Unlike modern zombie movies like those created by George A. Romero, the fear in these early films comes from being turned into a zombie rather than being killed by one (Dendle 3) (BISHOP, 2008:144)

<h3>BISHOP, MONSTRO, IMPERIALISMO</h3>
Unlike most movie monsters of the 1930s, the zombie was sired directly by the imperialist system. Creatures like Dracula, Frankenstein’s golem, and the werewolf were primarily European constructs, born of diverse western mythologies and ethnic folklore. The zombie, on the other hand, was a new monster for a New World—it was discovered in the actual contemporary religious practices and daily folklife of postcolonial societies in Haiti and the Caribbean. (BISHOP, 2008:145)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, COLONIALISMO</h3>
Furthermore, the zombie was an ideological manifestation of the social and political superstructure in these newly liberated colonies, using fear to encourage hard work and subservience. (BISHOP, 2008:145)

<h3>BISHOP,  HEGEL, DIALÉTICA, COLONIALISMO</h3>
When the western cinematic versions of these folkloric creatures are examined, zombies must be recognized as a metaphorical manifestation of the Hegelian master/slave relationship and the negative dichotomous social structure of colonialism. (BISHOP, 2008:145)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, ESCRAVO, MÁQUINA</h3>
 Although the original term zombi was a Creole word for ”‘spirit,’’ in voodoo culture it ironically refers to someone lacking a soul (Dayan 37). According to anthropologist Melville Herskovits, ‘‘in Dahomean legend the zombis were beings without souls, ‘whose death was not real but resulted from the machinations of sorcerers who made them appear as dead, and then, when buried, removed them from their grave and sold them into servitude in some far-away land’’’ (qtd. in Dayan 36). (BISHOP, 2008:145)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, HAITI, MORTO-VIVO, ESCRAVO, COLONIALISMO</h3>
Zombification results in the total capitulation of  autonomy, making it the most feared threat to the Haitian folk; becoming a zombie (either by having a sorcerer steal one’s spirit or by turning one into the ‘‘living dead’’) is the ‘‘most powerful emblem of apathy, anonymity, and loss’’ (Dayan 37). Dayan ultimately succeeds in tying the history of Haiti with the mythology of the zombie: ‘‘Born out of the experience of slavery, the sea passage from Africa to the New World, and revolution on the soil of Saint-Dominque, the zombi tells the story of colonization’’ (37) (BISHOP, 2008:145)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, ALTERIDADE, WHITE ZOMBIE, HEGEL, DIALÉTICA</h3>
By presenting the zombies as a manifest ‘‘Other’’ vis-a`-vis the human protagonists, movies like White Zombie echo G. F. W. Hegel’s (1931) master/slave dialectic. (BISHOP, 2008:145)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, HUMANO, VOODOO, COLONIALISMO, DIALÉTICA</h3>
Because zombies lack self-consciousness, autonomy, and the desire for liberation, an inflexible relationship exists between them and all humans. In the voodoo priest/zombie relationship, the interaction is fundamentally one sided: the zombie lacks the intellectual capacity to recognize the master at all, firmly closing Fanon’s circuit. Zombies thus represent an exaggerated model of colonial class/race segregation, for there is no possible dialectical model in such an exaggerated and literal master/slave relationship. (BISHOP, 2008:145-146)

<h3>BISHOP, COLONIALISMO, IMPERIALISMO, HUMANO, ALTERIDADE</h3>
This loss of agency and the reinstitution of a system of domination is a cultural manifestation of the colonial politics criticized by Aime´ Ce´saire. According to his ruminations in Discourse on Colonialism, the system of imperialism leads to the perception of other humans as animals, what Ce´saire calls the ‘‘boomerang effect of colonization’’ (41). By embracing an ideology of superiority, colonization fails to encourage human contact but rather the ‘‘relations of domination and submission’’; in other words, colonization means ‘‘thingification’’ (42) (BISHOP, 2008:146)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, IMPERIALISMO, AMEAÇA</h3>
In fact, the zombie represents the ultimate imperialist dream—a slave laborer that is truly a thing, unthinking, unaspiring, and nonthreatening. (BISHOP, 2008:146)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, WHITE ZOMBIE</h3>
The result is the exploitation of the proletariat worker, and the zombies in films like White Zombie are the ultimate manifestation of the subservient working class. (BISHOP, 2008:146)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, FALA</h3>
The zombies are not only subservient due to their lack of will and autonomy; they also lack the power of speech. (BISHOP, 2008:146)

<h3>BISHOP, SPIVAK, FALA, ZUMBI, SUB-SUBALTERNO</h3>
In Spivak’s critique, women and slaves constitute a social level beneath the lowest group, creating a fifth level that is doubly subordinated. This group is generally ignored and marginalized by not only the dominant foreign (i.e., white) class but also their own indigenous (i.e., native) populace. Spivak’s primarily interest lies in issues of (re)presentation, and the purpose of her investigation is to find ways of recognizing how members of the subalternized classes communicate. (BISHOP, 2008:146)

<h3>BISHOP, SUB-SUBALTERNO, FALA, AMEAÇA, IMPERIALISMO</h3>
Although the subaltern are ‘‘silent’’ in terms of official politics and culture, they do have the ability to talk with each other, which can potentially result in organization and revolution. The subaltern thus constitutes a potential threat to the imperialist powers, not merely a marginalized group worthy of intellectual study. (BISHOP, 2008:146)

<h3>BISHOP, SPIVAK, COLONIALISMO, ZUMBI, SUB-SUBALTERNO, AUTÔMATO, FALA</h3>
Spivak’s critique of the colonial class system relates to the social system of the zombie narrative as well. When the same hierarchy is applied to a film like White Zombie, the zombies constitute a sixth level—what I call the ‘‘sub-subaltern’’ class—below that of indigenous women and (living) slaves. They are subordinated for two reasons: (1) the master has no responsibilities toward a group of automatons that require little food, no pay, and no time off, and (2) the zombies have no voice, no opinions, no consciousness, and (most importantly) no ability to organize. (BISHOP, 2008:146)

<h3>BISHOP, SPIVAK, SUB-SUBALTERNO, ALTERIDADE, HUMANO</h3>
Thus, the sub-subaltern differ from Spivak’s conception in kind rather than merely degree. They are truly ‘‘other’’ because of their fundamental lack of humanity. (BISHOP, 2008:146)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, IMPERIALISMO, HAITI, VOODOO</h3>
Thus the invention of the zombie is a direct result of imperialism and cultural synthesis—the natives of French West Africa and emancipated slaves from the United States were relocated to the West Indies (and Haiti in particular) where their tribal beliefs were ‘‘integrated’’ with western Christian ideology. The result is a hybridized form of western voodoo mysticism, where natives offer food and wine to statues of the Virgin Mary, pray to their dead family members for guidance and protection, and hire priests and witch doctors to carve voodoo dolls of their enemies—and where supernatural creatures like the zombie represent the colonial experience. (BISHOP, 2008:146-147)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, IMPERIALISMO, VOODOO, ESCRAVO, ALTERIDADE, FALA</h3>
The creation and (mis)use of zombies is the perfect realization of the imperialist hegemonic model: those in power (or rather, those who have power, like a voodoo priest) can enslave and conquer others; those ‘‘others’’ literally lose their language as well as their autonomy—they are the ultimate iteration of the slave. (BISHOP, 2008:147)

<h3>BISHOP, FALA, AMEAÇA, ALTERIDADE, COLONIALISMO</h3>
Therefore, on one level, the zombie provides the oppressed the opportunity to oppress, and western civilization is thus threatened. Furthermore, making a zombie is a process of ‘‘uncivilization’’; the now exaggerated Other becomes subservient and marginalized—and unlike the educational and missionary efforts in most European colonies, there is no attempt made to civilize the zombies and improve their place in society. (BISHOP, 2008:147)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, HAITI, COLONIALISMO, IMPERIALISMO</h3>
The white western men are portrayed as superior to all the Haitians on multiple levels. Beaumont’s wealth and authority are almost overemphasized through the excesses of his mansion, clothing, and servants, and Dr. Bruner provides the scientific enlightenment to see the truth behind the native’s ‘‘foolish superstitions.’’ (BISHOP, 2008:149)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, ESCRAVO, WHITE ZOMBIE</h3>
Yet at the most fundamental level, Legendre is an aspiring capitalist—and the zombies are the definitive exploited proletariats. Although involved in the primarily agrarian trade of sugar cane production, the witch doctor has created a massive factory for the refining of that cane, and the majority of his zombies are not servants or bodyguards but ‘‘laborers in a capitalist regime’’ (Rhodes 45) (BISHOP, 2008:149)

<h3>BISHOP, WHITE ZOMBIE , COLONIALISMO</h3>
 In White Zombie, the protagonist couple is clearly white and American, the sagacious Dr. Bruner is a white Christian missionary, and even the treacherous Beaumont is shown to be superior to the natives in his dress, accommodations, and ultimate redemption. (BISHOP, 2008:149)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI </h3>
 Dr. Bruner tells Neil how he has been trying for years to challenge Legendre’s abominable practices (what he calls a sin even the devil would be ashamed of), but it takes the zombification of a white woman to spur him to action. By attacking Madeleine (and to a lesser extent, Beaumont), Legendre appears to cross a greater moral line. Thus, the white western Christian characters shift from tolerating the grisly practice of zombification among the natives to being incensed to ‘‘righteous’’ action. This sudden motivation manifests  ’s discourse on Hitler and his critique of France’s reaction to the rise of fascism—the West accepts barbarism committed against the so-called savages but reacts violently against barbarism committed against themselves (36) (BISHOP, 2008:150)

<h3>BISHOP, WHITE ZOMBIE</h3>
Ultimately, the real horror of films like White Zombie for its American and European audiences is the violation of the white heroine, the imposition of a native-centric hegemony on an enlightened westerner. (BISHOP, 2008:150)


<h3>BISHOP,  WHITE ZOMBIE, ESCRAVO, COLONIALISMO</h3>
To the westerner, unjust death in a foreign land is a better alternative to being made prisoner and slave to a primitive, ‘‘oriental’’ culture. This scenario represents the greatest fear of the colonizers—that the natives will rise up and become the dominating force. (BISHOP, 2008:150)

<h3>BISHOP, HAITI, ZUMBI, FALA, VÍTIMA</h3>
The Hatian zombies are doubly inferior and marginalized (as both blacks and slaves), and they can only be ‘‘rescued’’ by the white men of the West. Although the creatures are voiceless and lack autonomous minds and souls, they are still capable of representation by the white characters—Neil sees the zombification of Madeleine as the ultimate affront and recognizes her inherent purity in spite of her tragic state, and Dr. Bruner perceives the zombies as tragic and pitiful creatures, abused through Legendre’s black arts to defy the natural order of God. (BISHOP, 2008:150)

<h3>BISHOP, IMPERIALISMO, ZUMBI, WHITE ZOMBIE</h3>
In the end, the stereotypes of imperialism are proven to be the saving grace of the day: the white, God-fearing westerners triumph over the native pagan. The white zombie has been redeemed and returned to the loving arms of her capitalist husband, and the native zombies have been ‘‘put down’’ and destroyed by the cleansing power of God’s chosen servant. (BISHOP, 2008:151)

<h3>BISHOP, WHITE ZOMBIE, COLONIALISMO</h3>
Yet when read critically through the lens of colonial and postcolonial theory, a number of alarming themes and subtextual messages become apparent. (BISHOP, 2008:151)

<h3>BISHOP, WHITE ZOMBIE, COLONIALISMO, HAITI, IMPERIALISMO</h3>
Americans had failed to colonize Haiti directly, they ended up doing it after the fact by producing texts like White Zombie. Ultimately, the film cannot help but mirror colonial stereotypes and imperialist hegemony, establishing another link in the long chain of perceived western superiority in terms of economics, politics, religion, and race. (BISHOP, 2008:151)
