             <h3>MUNTEAN, CATÁSTROFE, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD</h3>
            
            Of course, the catastrophic events do not equally affectall characters within a film; for instance, in <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> (1968), Barbara (Judith O'Dea) is deeply traumatized by her first altercation with the zombies, leading to an unsettling catatonia that unnerves many of the other characters, such that her eventual willing submission to the crowd of flesh-eating undead comes as little surprise, for she had essentially become a zombie some time before (MUNTEAN, 2011, p. 82) 
            
             <h3>MUNTEAN, TRAUMA ZOMBIE</h3>
            
            That is, what might be most horrifying about these creatures - both the modern zombie and the trauma zombie - is the unspoken realization that these are the contours of our contemporary cultural nightmares, the conceivable ends reached by our collective capaticy for self-disgust (MUNTEAN, 2011, p. 83)
            
             <h3>MUNTEAN, ZUMBI MODERNO</h3>
            
            Thus, in the interests of analytic clarity, it is necessary to introduce the periodizing concept of the "modern zombie". This term, referring as it does to the flesh-eating, master-less zombie figure introduced most memorably by George Romero in <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>, is meant to distinguish the Romero zombie from the earlier, Vodou zombie, in which a single (usually white) sorcerer figure would extend his will through the mesmeric command of (usually black) laborers. In contrast, the modern zombie figure lacks any such centralized figure of agency and control, and it it considerably more gruesome in appearance and behavior than the earlier Vodou zombie. Whereas one of the principal terrors in the Vodou zombie narratives was the loss of self-control and self-identity through the imposition of the will of another individual, the modern zombie is terrifying precisely because no singular agent acts to prossess the victim's mind (MUNTEAN, 2011, p. 83)
            
             <h3>MUNTEAN,IDEOLOGIA, PÓS-HUMANO, ALTHUSSER </h3>
            
            In both of these (nearly) post-human environments, the characters are suddenly faced with a crisis of ideology. If we accept Louis Althusser's suggestion that ideology is "not the system of the real relations which govern the existence of individuals, but the imaginary relation of those individuals to the real relations in which they live", then it is clear that both the zombies and the characters in the <i>On the Beach</i> are post-ideological in some sense (MUNTEAN, 2011, p. 85)
            
             <h3>MUNTEAN, GUERRA NUCLEAR</h3>
            
            Yet even if a nuclear war did not occur, he was not particularly optimistic about the possibilities for humankind's future, as he believed that the next hundred years would simply be a continuation of the alienation and automatization that defined modern life in the early twentieth century: "In the nineteenth century the problem is that God is dead; in the twentieth century inhumanity meant cruelty; in the twentieth century it means schizoid self-alienation. The danger of the past was that men became slaves. The danger of the future is that men become robots. True enough, robots do not rebel. But given they destroy their world and themselves because they cannot stand any longer the boredom of a meaningless life (MUNTEAN, 2011, p. 86)
            
             <h3>MUNTEAN, DAWN OF THE DEAD</h3>
            
            The cause of trauma, argues Cathy Caruth, is "a shock that appears to work very much like a bodily threat but is in fact a break in the mind's experience of time". This notion of a rupture in temporal order is usually understood as occuring in a flash of fleeting subjective experience - the traumatic event itself - though with respect to <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> and <i>On the Beach</i>, we can conceive of this traumatic event as extending to cover all the characters' post-social lives (MUNTEAN, 2011, p. 87)
            
             <h3>MUNTEAN, ALIENAÇÃO</h3>
            
            There are strong parallels between the epistemological severance that occurs through the traumatic experience and the ideological vastation of the post-social environment, as well as that of schizoid self-alienation, as in all three scenarios the individual finds him - or herself in a world where the larger social structures through which we maintain our identities on a daily basis are either absent, inaccesible, or malicious (MUNTEAN, 2011, p. 88)
            
             <h3>MUNTEAN, DAWN OF THE DEAD</h3>
            
            In <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>, the survivors engage in the cultural patterns of pre-apocalyptic society as a means of generating their own positive identity, of distinguishing themselves from the culture-less undead that surrounds them (MUNTEAN, 2011, p. 89)
            
             <h3>MUNTEAN, HUMANIDADE</h3>
            
            Indeed, Giorgio Agamben notes that the title of Primo Levi's concentration camp memoir, <i>Se questo è un uomo</i>, literally means "if this is a man" (this text was first published in English as <i>Survival in Auchwitz</i>), suggesting that "in Auchwitz ethics begins precisely at the point where the Muselmann, the 'complete witness', makes it forever impossible to distinguish between man and non-man". (MUNTEAN, 2011, p. 91)
            
             <h3>MUNTEAN, MUSSELMANN</h3>
            
            The Muselmann, like the zombie, is a line, heterogeneus and indivisible, more terrifying in its unassimilable liminality than the dark region it delineates: "I remember that while we were going down the stairs leading to the baths, they had us accompanied by a group of <i>Muselmänner</i>, as we later called them - mummy-men, the living dead (MUNTEAN, 2011, p. 92)
            
             <h3>MUNTEAN, MUSSELMANN, UNCANNY </h3>
            
            While the physical process of becoming a Muselmann began with generalized malnutrition and starvation, it was only in the second stage that the transformation, both mental and physical, truly began to take hold. The physical similarities between the Muselmänner and the modern zombie are uncanny - even the language employed by survivors to describe them ("living dead", "staggering corpse") immediately denotes zombies (MUNTEAN, 2011, p. 92)
            
             <h3>MUNTEAN, CONSCIÊNCIA, </h3>
            
            In this sense, the modern zombie's mute lack of consciousness performs a similar function for modern society writ large, embodying the terrifying rapacious yet autonomous mechanisms through which subjects' consumption is purposed as a (re)productive act, the end point of the ideological and material processes through which late capitalism predicates its growth and stability on autophagic strategies of debt and credit (MUNTEAN, 2011, p. 92-93)
            
             <h3>MUNTEAN, MORTE PROLONGADA </h3>
            
            For unlike the traditional mode of dying, in which the cessation of biological and psychic processes occurs roughly simultaneously, the Muselmänner and hibakusha embody a gruesome reimagining of the process, in which physical death, believed to be preordained and imminent, becomes a prolonged process, both producing and produced by the psychic death, which precedes the nearly invisible moment at which the body's life funcions cease (MUNTEAN, 2011, p. 93)
            
             <h3>MUNTEAN, TRAUMA ZOMBIE, PULSÕES</h3>
            
            Yet because the trauma zombie is a less figurative category than the modern zombie, it consistently retains a critical potential that the real zombie may, at certain times, lack. Upon being traumatized, sundered from their ideological and semantic systems, the trauma zombie is reduced to bare drives, that "untamed root that exists prior to all cultural development", a state of death in life that is the perverse obverse of the modern zombie's life in death (MUNTEAN, 2011, p. 95)
            
             <h3>MUNTEAN, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, HUMANIDADE</h3>
            
            In <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>, for instance, the confrontation between humanity and its abject double could be considered, at best, a stalemate, and at worst, humans ultimately destroy themselves in the process of attempting to destroy that which threatens them (MUNTEAN, 2011, p. 96)
            
             <h3>MUNTEAN, HORROR, TRAUMA ZOMBIE</h3>
            
            Bridging the gap between the allegorical horrors conceived by our collective imaginations and the actual horrors of the real world, the trauma zombie is a compelling character that serves to reveal more about the nature of zombies and the societies that deploy them as myths (MUNTEAN, 2011, p. 97)
