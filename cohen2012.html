<h2>COHEN, 2012</h2>

<h3>COHEN, AGÊNCIA, HUMANO, REALISMO ESPECULATIVO</h3>
To  provoke  and  frame  my  thinking  I have  been  researching  ecological  approaches  to  literature  and  the  reconsideration  of  the  agency  of  the  inhuman  that  has  been  called  speculative  realism (and  more  specifically,  object  oriented  philosophy). (COHEN, 2012:398)

<h3>COHEN, MORTO-VIVO, MONSTRO</h3>
 Un-dead  is  not  the  same  as  alive,  nor  does  it  allow  for  the  quiescence of  mortality.  Undead  names  the  zone  of  restless  and  perplexing  activity  from which  monsters  arrive,  a  gap  in  the  fabric  of  the  known  world  that  opens  a space  neither  real  nor  chimerical,  a  breach  in  which  everything  familiar  loses its  certainty—including  what  constitutes  life. (COHEN, 2012:398)

<h3>COHEN, HAITI, ZUMBI</h3>
In  one  of  our  earliest  accounts  of  folklore  in  Haiti,  Zora  Neale  Hurston described  the  zombie  as  a  body  without  soul.  Hurston  published  her  research in  1938,  and  although  zombies  enjoyed  a  brief  vogue  in  contemporary  film they  did  not  so  thoroughly  saturate  pop  culture  until  fairly  recently. (COHEN, 2012:398)

<h3>COHEN, MORTO-VIVO, ROMERO</h3>
Our  undead  are  no  longer  ethereal  and  philosophical  specters,  but  have  become  shambling,  putrefying,  flesh  hungry  corpses whose  urtext  is  not  Hamlet,  the  Odyssey  or  “The  Communist  Manifesto”  but  a low  budget  film  by  George  Romero  (Night  of  the  Living  Dead,  1968) (COHEN, 2012:399)

<h3>COHEN, TRANSFORMAÇÃO, HUMANO</h3>
What  is  at  stake  in  this  material  turn,  this  movement  from  cognition  to  consumption,  from  subjectivity  and  personhood  to  mere  corporeality, the  human  as  yet  another  object  in  an  object-filled  world? (COHEN, 2012:399)

<h3>COHEN,  MONSTRO, ZUMBI, FALA</h3>
Whereas  many  familiar  monsters  are  singular  and  alluring  characters,  zombies  are  a  collective,  a  swarm. They  do  not  own  individualizing  stories.  They  do  not  have  personalities.  They eat.  They  kill.  They  shamble.  They  suffer  and  they  cause  suffering.  They  are dirty,  stinking  and  poorly  dressed.  They  are  indifferent  to  their  own  decay. (COHEN, 2012:400)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, EPIDEMIA</h3>
The  notion  of  an  impending  zombie  apocalypse is  so  widespread  that  a  bestselling  handbook  instructs  you  on  how  to  survive the  event.  Over  a  million  copies  have  been  sold  of  Max  Brooks’s  The  Zombie Survival  Guide:  Complete  Protection  from  the  Living  Dead.  Inspired  perhaps  by its  success,  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  in  Atlanta  recently  published  the graphic  novella  Preparedness  101:  Zombie  Pandemic,  self-described  as  “a  fun new  way  of  teaching  about  emergency  preparedness.” (COHEN, 2012:400)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI</h3>
Peter  Dendle’s  The  Zombie  Movie  Encyclopedia  (2001)  lists  over  two hundred  films.  Jamie  Russell’s  The  Book  of  the  Dead:  The  Complete  History  of Zombie  Cinema  (2005)  adds  many  more  to  that  list.  (COHEN, 2012:400)

<h3>COHEN, MONSTRO, ZUMBI</h3>
Any  monster  that  captures  the  imagination  long  enough  will  inhabit  three intimately  related  cultural  registers  simultaneously:  horror,  comedy,  and  children’s  media.  The  zombie  is  no  exception.  Horror  is  our  mode  for  mapping what  we  fear.  As  a  perilous  incarnation  of  collective  anxieties,  an  ultimate terror,  the  zombie  menaces  the  integrity  of  our  systems  of  belonging,  both metaphorical  (the  nation,  the  family)  and  literal  (the  body). (COHEN, 2012:401)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, MORTO-VIVO, </h3>
Just  as  the  zombie  swarm  has  captured  various  films,  games,  books  and  television,  so  the  critical  explanations  for  the  zombie’s  recent  ubiquity  are  legion. Some  excellent  scholarship  has  been  published  on  the  embodied  undead,  from Jeffrey  Weinstock’s  prescient  essay  “Zombie  TV”  to  the  recent  and  insightful collection  Better  off  Dead:  The  Evolution  of  the  Zombie  as  Post-Human  and  Kyle William  Bishop’s  American  Zombie  Gothic. (COHEN, 2012:402)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, DESCARTES</h3>
Studying  zombies  is yet  another  mode  of  enjoying  them,  and  this  paradox  inheres  in  their  analysis: to  understand  the  zombie’s  cultural  significance  it  is  necessary  to  transform  a creature  that  is  all  body  into  a  cerebral  puzzle.  Or  maybe  it  is  to  admit  that  the division  between  corporeal  and  intellectual  pleasures—and  phenomena—is not  sustainable. (COHEN, 2012:402)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, MONSTRO, HAITI</h3>
The  zombie  is  a  monster  polyvalent  enough  to  incorporate  a  multitude  of  fears,  desires,  traumas  and  hopes.  Because  the  word  zombie  migrated from  Africa  to  Haiti  to  the  United  States  and  thence  to  Europe,  zombies might  seem  transnational  and  epochal,  but  that  does  not  mean  they  are  not historicizable. (COHEN, 2012:402)

<h3>COHEN, ROMERO, COLONIALISMO</h3>
George  Romero’s  ghouls  in  Night  of  the  Living  Dead,  for  example, offered  “an  allegorical  condemnation  of  the  atrocities  of  Vietnam,  violent racism,  and  the  opposition  to  the  civil  rights  movement”  (Bishop  14). (COHEN, 2012:402)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, HUMANO</h3>
Zombies  are  proliferating  at  the  same  time  as  our  reigning  fad  diet  is  the Paleolithic,  extolling  the  consumption  of  raw  foods.8  Meat-loving  and  contemptuous  of  grains,  the  Paleo  Diet  renounces  agricultural  humanity  for  a fantasy of primal hunter-gatherers who devoured what they killed or snatched with  their  own  hands. (COHEN, 2012:403)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, HUMANO</h3>
We  might  even  be  tempted  to  label  both  the Paleo  and  Zombie  diets  green:  what  could  be  more  natural,  more  eco-friendly, than  a  culinary  regime  that  leaves  so  small  an  environmental  footprint?  In  the end,  however,  zombie  diets  are  actually  the  more  sustainable,  since  humans are  in  fact  the  most  neglected  meat  in  a  flesh-loving  culture.  Zombies  know that deer, horses, and humans all make good eating, and they were early practitioners  of  snout-to-tail  dining. (COHEN, 2012:403)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, FALA, </h3>
Zombies  are  never  individualized.  They  present  the  single  human  collective  about  whom  we  can  without  hesitation  speak  in  terms  of  determinative mental  traits,  communal  bodily  designators,  and  stereotyped  characteristics. Zombies  offer  a  permissible  groupthinking  of  the  other.  We  feel  no  shame  in declaring  their  bodies  repulsive.  They  eat  disgusting  food.  They  possess  no coherent  language;  it  all  sounds  like  grunts  and  moans.  They  desire  everything we  possess.  They  are  a  danger  from  without  that  is  already  within. (COHEN, 2012:403)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, RACISMO</h3>
Applied  to  any  other  group,  such  homogenizing  reduction  and obsession  with  physicality,  communal  menace,  and  fantastic  consumption would  constitute  racism.  But  the  zombie  is  a  body  from  which  the  person  has departed,  so  we  can  talk  about  them  without  worrying  about  nuance  or  bigotry. (COHEN, 2012:404)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, RACISMO</h3>
The  folkloric zombie  is  a  reduction  of  person  to  body:  an  utterly  dehumanized  laborer,  compelled  relentlessly  to  toil,  brutally  subjugated  even  in  death.  Old  tropes  gain new  life  in  the  contemporary  zombie’s  body:  regardless  of  its  skin  color,  we speak  of  the  undead  in  terms  inherited  from  racialist  discourse. (COHEN, 2012:404)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI</h3>
As  The Walking  Dead  TV  series  made  clear  in  an  episode  entitled  “Vatos”  (1.4),  featuring  a  Latino  “gang”  whose  bluster  hides  the  fact  that  they  are  caring  for  the elderly  in  abandoned  nursing  home,  life  after  the  zombie  apocalypse  does  not mark  a  radical  break  for  everyone. (COHEN, 2012:404)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, DERRIDA</h3>
Jacques  Derrida  obliquely  predicted  the  zombie  advent  (where  zombies convey  human  suffering)  in  1993  when  he  published  Specters  of  Marx,  a  book critiquing  the  triumphalism  that  attended  the  fall  of  the  Berlin  Wall. (COHEN, 2012:404)

<h3>COHEN, HUMANO, EXTINÇÃO, ESCRAVO</h3>
Never  have  violence,  inequality,  exclusion,  famine,  and  thus  economic oppression  affected  as  many  human  beings  in  the  history  of  the  earth  and  of humanity… instead  of  celebrating  the  “end  of  ideologies”  and  the  end  of the  great  emancipatory  discourses,  let  us  never  neglect  this  obvious  macroscopic  fact,  made  up  of  innumerable  singular  sites  of  suffering:  no  degree  of progress  allows  one  to  ignore  that  never  before,  in  absolute  figures,  have  so many  men,  women  and  children  been  subjugated,  starved  or  exterminated on  the  earth.  (DERRIDA, 1993:85)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI</h3>
From specter  to  zombie:  is  it  any  wonder  that  an  ardor  for  the  end  of  history  has been  swept  away  by  an  apocalypse  that  involves  “violence,  inequality,  exclusion,  famine...  innumerable  singular  sites  of  suffering”?  The  zombie  figures the  return  of  the  injustices  we  quietly  practice  against  people  we  prefer  to  keep invisible. (COHEN, 2012:404)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, ESCRAVO, SUB-SUBALTERNO</h3>
Zombies  can  be  a  dominating  culture’s  figures  for  groups  against  whom violence  and  exclusion  are  systematically  performed.  They  can  figure  the forgotten,  exploited,  and  dehumanized  who  return.  Zombies  can  also  serve  as an  allegory  for  that  culture  in  its  entirety,  or  at  least  for  its  dominating  ethos. (COHEN, 2012:405)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, IMPERIALISMO</h3>
Creatures  of  pure  consumption  and  drive,  zombies  are  the  logical  products  of capitalism.  Relentlessly  driven  to  devour,  grasp,  extract  and  expend,  the  zombie covers just about every  signification of the word “consumer.” (COHEN, 2012:405)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, ROMERO, IMPERIALISMO, </h3>
Thus George Romero  infamously  set  Dawn  of  the  Dead  (1978)  in  a  shopping  mall,  where  in a  memorable  scene  the  zombies  are  glimpsed  riding  the  escalators  to  a  cheerful Muzak  soundtrack.  Yet  zombies  may  also  embody  corporate  forces.  In  Night of  the  Living  Dead,  a  film  financed  through  borrowed  money,  Romero  placed the  zombies  creditor-like  around  a  house.  Their  violence  is  directed  at  both property  and  bodies.  Their  siege  is  a  kind  of  foreclosure. (COHEN, 2012:405)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, HUMANO, EXTINÇÃO, IMPERIALISMO</h3>
We  are  haunted  by  zombies because  we  experience  embodiment  as  a  drag  against  the  internet-induced fantasy  of  incorporeality.  Perhaps  we  no  longer  dream  of  ghosts  because  we have  become  them.  We  dis-identify  with  zombies  by  slaughtering  them  en masse,  allowing  us  to  sustain  our  desire  for  an  electronic  realm  where  we  are freed  from  fleshly  restraint. (COHEN, 2012:405)

<h3>COHEN, LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, ESCRAVO</h3>
As  Sarah  Juliet  Lauro  and  Karen Embry  observe  in  “A  Zombie  Manifesto”:  “The  irony  is  that  while  the  statement  prompts  us  to  ask  what  kind  of  life  that  would  be,  it  reveals  that  our fascination  with  the  zombie  is,  in  part,  a  celebration  of  its  immortality  and  a recognition  of  ourselves  as  enslaved  to  our  bodies”  (88) (COHEN, 2012:405)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, MONSTRO</h3>
For  all  their  fabled  stupidity,  zombies  reveal themselves  as  complex  and  contradictory  creatures,  at  least  when  viewed  as an  aggregate  of  their  many  versions. (COHEN, 2012:405)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, MORTO-VIVO</h3>
A  leader  sometimes  emerges,  or  a  zombie  reveals  himself  as smarter  than  the  rest,  able  to  replicate  an  elaborate  snare  (I  Am  Legend), able  to  discern  that  the  people  smeared  in  horse  guts  are  trying  to  pass  as  the undead  (The  Walking  Dead) (COHEN, 2012:406)

<h3>COHEN, ROMERO, ZUMBI, IMPERIALISMO</h3>
Yet  in  Dawn of  the  Dead  the  zombies  return  to  the  mall  because  in  life  they  were  happy  in that  consumer  paradise. (COHEN, 2012:406)
    
<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, HUMANO, MONSTRO, </h3>
  Zombies  are  a  kind  of  ultimate enemy,  because  they  are  so  utterly  inhuman  .  .  .  and  yet  we  humans  always  turn out  to  be  worse  than  the  zombies  we  fight.  We  form  our  collectives  in  order  to do  battle  with  these  monsters,  and  then  we  turn  on  each  other  and  display  a zombie-like  aggression  against  what  should  be  our  community. (COHEN, 2012:406)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, HUMANO</h3>
J.  J.  Abrams’s  Super  8  (2011)  is  a  zombie  movie  about  the zero-state  of  emotionality  to  which  trauma  reduces  masculine  bodies;  it  takes  a boy  to  demonstrate  to  a  monstrous  spider  and  to  his  own  dad—both  of  whom have  been  psychologically  scarred—how  to  escape  zombiedom  and  finally  love. (COHEN, 2012:406)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, HUMANO</h3>
  Men  in  the  narrative  have  trouble  articulating  needs,  desires, and  emotions;  when  they  do,  disaster  ensues.  The  zombies  meanwhile  are  not emotionally  dead;  they  are  unremittingly  expressive—of  anger,  of  insatiable hunger,  of  trauma.  They  are  raw.  The  zombies  embody  what  the  men  feel. (COHEN, 2012: 406)

<h3>COHEN, THE WALKING DEAD</h3>
To  return  to  the  “Vatos”  episode  of  The  Walking  Dead:  though  sometimes too  saccharine,  the  narrative  of  the  Latino  “gang”  brilliantly  juxtaposes  an industrial  and  fortress-like  facility  where  the  elderly  had  been  placed  to  spend their  last  days  with  the  transformed  streets  of  Atlanta,  an  urban  space  made strange  because  traversed  by  dying,  decaying,  disabled  bodies. (COHEN, 2012:406)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, ALTERIDADE, MORTO-VIVO, EXTINÇÃO, AGÊNCIA, </h3>
  Surrounded  by  injunctions to  conceal,  costume  and  enjoy,  we  outsource  the  corpse  to  morticians,  health care  personnel,  hospice  workers  and  custodians.  Yet  the  zombie’s  decay  is  not, in  the  end,  an  indication  of  its  deadness.  The  zombie’s  body  vividly  exhibits the  indifference  of  our  materiality  to  the  supposed  superiority  or  control  or beauty  of  the  subjectivity  that  is  supposed  to  reside  within.  Undead:  the  zombie  is  life  in  death.  Decomposition  is  the  thriving  of  bacteria,  the  autonomy  of the  world,  an  unyielding  demonstration  of  the  inhuman  agency  that  resides  in the  pieces  and  substances  that  we  totalize  for  a  while  into  a  body  we  call  ours. (COHEN, 2012:407)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, HARMAN, OOO</h3>
Decay  is  a  process  of  transformation.  It  seems  final,  fatal,  and  terminal  .  .  .  but this  activity  is  future  directed,  creative  and  uninterested  in  our  mourning.  The zombie’s  ongoing  putrefaction  makes  evident  an  Object  Oriented  Ontology (OOO),  which  Graham  Harman  defines  as  a  thing-centric  mode  of  philosophical  analysis  in  which  “individual  entities  of  various  different  scales... are the  ultimate  stuff  of  the  cosmos”  and  “these  entities  are  never  exhausted  by any  of  their  relations  or  even  by  their  sum  of  all  possible  relations”  (“Brief”).  (COHEN, 2012:407)

<h3>COHEN, OOO, AGÊNCIA, MORTO-VIVO, ZOO</h3>
OOO  is  a  non-anthropocentric  philosophy  in  which  things  possess  agency, autonomy,  and  ultimate  mystery.  The  walking  dead  offer  what  might  be  called a  ZOO,  a  zombie  oriented  ontology,  which  makes  evident  the  objectal  status of  the  body  as  a  heterogeneous  concatenation  of  parts,  working  in  harmonious  relation,  or  exerting  their  own  will,  or  entropically  vanishing. (COHEN, 2012:407)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, HUMANO</h3>
The  zombie  is  the  inhuman  reality  of  the  body,  our  composition  by  volitional  objects  that  sometimes  work  together  and  sometimes do  not.  The  zombie  is  therefore  repugnant:  we  do  not  like  to  behold  our  own viscerality,  our  own  material  composition.  But  that  does  not  mean  zombies  do not  possess  an  aesthetic.  They  do,  but  it  is  a  dark,  worldly,  challenging,  and embodied  one.  In  a  strange  way  it  can  also  be  beautiful. (COHEN, 2012:407)

<h3>COHEN, VOODOO, HAITI, WHITE ZOMBIE, MÁQUINA, ROMERO, ESCRAVO</h3>
Bishop,  to  be  clear,  is  speaking  of  the  body  without  a  soul descended  from  Haitian  voodoo  and  films  like  White  Zombie  (dir.  Victor  Halperin,  1932).  These  animated  and  enslaved  corpses  are  human  robots.  They have  lost  their  personality  and  will.  To  this  creature  George  Romero  will  add cannibalism  and  subtract  a  controlling  master  to  yield  the  zombie  familiar today,  a  monster  that  no  longer  seems  to  have  so  direct  a  connection  to  Haiti or  slavery,  and  yet  (as  we  have  seen)  is  thoroughly  if  ambivalently  racialized. (COHEN, 2012:408)

<h3>COHEN, MORTO-VIVO, TRANSCULTURAL, MONSTRO, MORTE, HUMANO</h3>
  Like  dragons  and  giants,  the  walking  dead are  transcultural  monsters,  haunting  nearly  every  geography  and  history.  Our hope  and  our  fear  that  death  is  not  the  end  of  life  amount  to  the  same  thing, yielding  gods  who  rise  from  the  dead  to  redeem  us  as  well  as  humans  who  rise from  the  dead  to  feed  upon  us. (COHEN, 2012:408)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, TRANSFORMAÇÃO, PÓS-HUMANO, MORTO-VIVO, ANTROPOCENTRISMO</h3>
Zombies  are  creatures  who  have  no  need  of  shelter.  They  do  not build.  They  exist  in  an  uncultured  state.  Perhaps  they  incarnate  our  fears  of inimical  nature.  Yet  they  are  in  the  end  too  separate  from  their  worlds,  too autonomous,  too  solitarily  human.  The  zombies  of  the  apocalypse  never  quite break  from  anthropomorphism.  Humans  living  and  undead  both  inhabit  the same  limited  ambit.  Even  if  they  sometimes  devour  animals,  zombies  generally eat  only  live  human  beings,  not  each  other,  and  never  plants:  their  diet  is  evidence  enough  of  how  circumscribed  their  monstrosity  remains.  Zombies  might be  literally  post-human  but  they  remain  disappointingly  anthropocentric. (COHEN, 2012: 409)

<h3>COHEN, ZOO, MORTO-VIVO, ZUMBI </h3>
This  inhuman  ecology  is  a  part  of  our Zombie  Oriented  Ontology,  one  in  which  we  realize  it  is  not  simply  the  human body  that  is  an  assemblage  of  discordant,  agential  and  envitalized  objects,  but the  earth  itself.  “Undead”  means  “differently  alive.”  The  very  ground  we  walk upon,  our  future  tomb,  is  alive  in  its  supposed  inertness,  forever  on  the  move, a  foundation  as  well  as  our  ruin,  the  undead  material  from  which  we  construct our  worlds. (COHEN, 2012:409)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, FALA</h3>
But  even  more  recent  zombies can  be  such  catalysts,  despite  their  inability  to  speak  in  iambic  pentameter, despite  their  seeming  lack  of  artistic  power.  A  symphony  of  flowing  crimson and  body  parts  autonomously  alive,  the  zombie  aesthetic  is  disturbing,  and that means it can be inspiring: it is fruitful to think with. (COHEN, 2012:410)

<h3>COHEN, ZUMBI, MORTO-VIVO, </h3>
Yet in the  end I wish we  could  have  our  zombies  without  desiring  so  ardently  an  apocalypse  to  go with  them.  Apocalypse  is  ultimately  a  failure  of  the  imagination.  Apocalypse signals  giving  up  on  the  future  instead  of  committing  to  the  difficult  work  of composing  a  better  present.  Those  who  dream  of  the  purgation  of  our  problems  rather  than  commit  to  the  labor  of  repair  choose  an  easier  path.  No wonder  the  zombies  destroy  them.  To  be  undead  might  mean  something  more than  to  inhabit  a  terminal  world,  a  vastness  reduced  to  earthbound  despair. (COHEN, 2012:410)

<h3>COHEN, HUMANO, NÃO-HUMANO</h3>
Zombies  without  apocalypse  might  offer  a  future  in  which  we  recognize  the suffering,  the  possibilities,  the  potency  and  the  dignity  of  our  fellow  humans and  our  fellow  nonhumans  alike. (COHEN, 2012:410)
