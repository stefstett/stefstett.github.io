             <h3>GIBSON, ZUMB, METÁFORA</h3>
            
            Here is a list, very incomplete, of things one should keep in mind when attempting to write seriously about zombies. Zombies do not exist. Zombies are not related to werewolves or vampires. Zombies are not, literally, mindless consumers, enraged proletarians, or stupid Americans - although some were perhaps once these things - and there is little use in casting them, even metaphorically, as <i>essentially</i> such, especially when attempting to offer a "theory of zombies" (GIBSON, 2014, p. 416)
            
             <h3>GIBSON, ADORNO, NÃO-IDENTIDADE</h3>
            
            To borrow a term from Theodor W. Adorno, it is a sense of inescapable "nonidentity" between how we perceive, speak, and think about the world and the way the world <i>actually</i> is - say, a sense that everything we rely upon when we attempt to understand the world might be spectacularly ill-suited for the task at hand (GIBSON, 2014, p. 419)
