    <h3>YANCY, NEGROS, WHITE GAZE</h3>
    The history of the Black body in North America is fundamentally linked
to the history of whiteness, primarily as whiteness is expressed in the form
of fear, sadism, hatred, brutality, terror, avoidance, desire, denial, solipsism,
madness, policing, politics, and the production and projection of white fantasies (YANCY, 2017, s.n.p.)
    
    <h3>YANCY, WHITE GAZE</h3>
    The Black body is deemed the quintessential object of the
ethnographic gaze, the “strange,” exotic, and fascinating object of anthropology. The Black body is constructed as antithetical within a binary logic that
points to the white body’s own “signifying [and material] forces to call attention to itself ” as normative.4
 Indeed, whiteness is deemed the transcendental
norm, the good, the innocent, and the pure, while Blackness is the diametrical
opposite. This is the twisted fate of the Black body vis-à-vis white forms
of disciplinary control, processes of white racist embodied habituation, and
epistemic white world-making. (YANCY, 2017, s.n.p.)
    
    <h3>YANCY, VIOLÊNCIA, WHITE GAZE</h3>
    Lynched, castrated, raped, branded, mutilated, whipped, socially sequestered, profiled, harassed, policed, disproportionately arrested and incarcerated,
the Black body has endured a history of more than symbolic white violence. (YANCY, 201, s.n.p.)
    
    <h3>YANCY, WHITE GAZE, </h3>
    On any given day in North America, the Black body vis-à-vis the white
gaze—that performance of distortional “seeing” that evolves out of and
is inextricably linked to various raced and racist myths, white discursive
practices, and centripetal processes of white systemic power and white
solipsism—undergoes processes of dehumanizing interpellation. The white
gaze, given the power of the ocular metaphor in Western culture, is an important site of power and control, a site that is structured by white epistemic
orders and that perpetuates such orders in turn. (YANCY, 2017, s.n.p)
    
    <h3>YANCY, WHITE GAZE </h3>
    Whites who use racist descriptions form part of a long racist history of
those who have controlled, and continue to control, not only the power to
denigrate Black bodies through language but also to murder and dismember
those bodies. Within the context of white racist America, whites inherited the
privileged status of being the “lookers” and gazers, with all the power that
this entailed. (YANCY, 2017, s.n.p.)
    
    <h3>YANCY, WHITE GAZE</h3>
    The depiction of the Black body as the quintessence of evil has endured
across historical space and time. (YANCY, 2017, s.n.p.0
    
    <h3>YANCY, WHITE GAZE, SIMBOLISMO</h3>
    As I hope to show throughout this text, it is not only the Black body that
defies the fixed fantasies and distorted images projected upon it through the
white gaze, and, hence, through the episteme of whiteness, but the white body
is also fundamentally symbolic, requiring demystification and exposure of its
status as the norm, the paragon of beauty, order, innocence, purity, restraint,
and nobility. In other words, given the assumptions about the body stated
above, both the Black body and the white body lend themselves to processes
of interpretive fracture, moments of disarticulation. (YANCY, 2017, s.n.p.)
    
        <h3>YANCY, HUMANIDADE</h3>
    There is
something very peculiar about being human and having to demonstrate that
humanity, to announce it, to fight for it to be recognized. There is not only the
ridiculous redundancy of such a need but also the profound pathology of the
conditions under which Black people find it necessary to proclaim, “Our lives
matter!” (YANCY, 2017, s.n.p.)

            <h3>YANCY, FANON, WHITE GAZE, MANIQUEÍSMO</h3>
    Fanon knew that the Black body is made “out
of a thousand [white racist] details, anecdotes, [and] stories.”11 It is these
racist details that are part of the “visible epidermal terrain”12 of the Black
body that constituted/constitutes the site of otherness within the framework
of a deeper, historically embedded, axiological, racial Manichean divide that
goes back to Europe itself, an epidermal terrain that continues, even today,
to signify “truths” regarding the entire cartography, as it were, of the Black
body. (YANCY, 2017, s.n.p.)

            <h3>YANCY, WHITE GAZE</h3>
    It is
a process of racist ascription through a visual technology that “knows” the
Black body well in advance. (YANCY, 2017, s.n.p.)

            <h3>YANCY, WHITE GAZE</h3>
    The white gaze, then, is a site of racist sedimentation that viciously
operates in the present. (YANCY, 2017, s.n.p.)

            <h3>YANCY, WHITE GAZE</h3>
    So, my Black body, one that is fungible vis-à-vis other Black bodies that
are deemed criminal, scary, monstrous, demonic, has already undergone a
process of racial interpellation that has done metaphysical violence, where,
historically, the governing norms of white philosophical anthropology
marked Black bodies as disgusting and occluded from the realm of the
conceptually white anthropos. (YANCY, 2017, s.n.p.)

            <h3>YANCY, WHITE GAZE, CIVILIZAÇÃO</h3>
     How does one rape such
a “creature” with such intimate proximity without moral revulsion or even
vomiting? How does one rape enslaved Black women without falsifying
one’s own assumptions about their status as “beasts of burden” or one’s own
white status as “civilized”? In other words, think about the lynching of Black
male bodies and how white males hovered over those Black bodies, making
sure that the nooses were fitted correctly, touching Black genitalia while castrating those intimate parts that were said to be nasty and despicable. These
cases constitute forms of violent, racially perverse, intimacy that implicated
white male desire, disgust, and hatred. (YANCY, 2017, s.n.p.)

            <h3>YANCY, EPISTEMOLOGIA, WHITE GAZE</h3>
    To practice forms of epistemological humility vis-à-vis whiteness will be necessary for white people to challenge whiteness as the transcendental norm that actually conditions their perception of themselves as not
needing to undo anything at all. As the transcendental norm, whiteness elides
itself as a problem. (YANCY, 2017, s.n.p.)

            <h3>YANCY, FANON, WHITE GAZE</h3>
    Frantz Fanon observed that “not only must the black man be black; he must
be black in relation to the white man.”9
 This relational dimension is incredibly significant.10 Hence, the meaning of my Blackness is constituted and
configured (relationally) within a semiotic field of axiological difference, one
that is structured vis-à-vis the construction of whiteness as the transcendental
norm (YANCY, 2017, p. 19).

    
            <h3>YANCY, WHITE GAZE</h3>
Phenomenologically, she might be said to “see” a Black,
fleeting expanse, a peripherally glimpsed vague presence of something dark,
forbidden, and dreadful. She does not see a dynamic subjectivity, but a sort,
something eviscerated of individuality, flattened, and rendered vacuous of
genuine human feelings. However, she is one of the “walking dead,” unaware of how the feeling of her white bodily upsurge and expansiveness is
purchased at the expense of my Black body. (YANCY, 2017, p. 21)
    
            <h3>YANCY, WHITE GAZE</h3>
    Moreover, such representations helped sustain the white gaze. Of
course, the white gaze continues to get its sustenance through various media
representations of Black bodies. (YANCY, 2017, p. 30)

            <h3>YANCY, WHITE GAZE</h3>
The point here is that the white gaze as a racist socio-epistemic aperture
will “see” a threatening Black body in white. (YANCY, 2017, p. 31)
    
            <h3>YANCY, WHITE GAZE</h3>
    Whiteness sets itself up as the thesis.
Within the dialectical logic of whiteness, Blackness must be the antithesis. (YANCY, 2017, p. 38)
