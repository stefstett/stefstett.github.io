<h3>LILLY, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA, APOCALIPSE </h3>

Why do climate change and natural disasters summon apocalyptic
ideas? (LILLY, 2016, p. 359)

<h3>LILLY, QUATRO CAVALEIROS, APOCALIPSE, COP15</h3>

The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse rode through the streets of
Copenhagen in 2009. A meeting of world leaders for the climate
change summit prompted the environmental group Greenpeace to
stage a demonstration using four protesters on horseback, attired as
those figures from the book of Revelation. The organizers saw
rhetorical potential in the Four Horsemen as symbolizations of Famine, (LILLY, 2016, p. 360)

<h3>LILLY, APOCALIPSE, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA, ILUMINISMO</h3>

Apocalyptic motifs, strategies, and genres about climate change are
on the rise. In this essay, I will explore three aspects of this cultural
discourse. First, apocalyptic discourse tends to highlight and even
widen ideological rifts. A veritable war of apocalyptic rhetoric pits
science against climate change denial, environmentalists against
industrialists, and reason against fantasy. This diabolical context is a
consistent and important aspect of modern-day apocalyptic rhetoric.
Second, climate change represents a crisis in Enlightenment science.
Modern science owes its success to the Age of Enlightenment in which
reason and empiricism replaced traditional authorities and ancient
knowledge systems. Its cosmological principles about space and time
structured a view of the planet without intrinsic value. Climate change
is science’s catastrophic end—in other words, it is science’s apocalypse.
What I am calling the Enlightenment science apocalypse is perhaps the
most distinctive cultural development in the new millennium. Third,
popular culture tells more and more stories that are set in a context
of natural disasters caused by anthropogenic climate change. A brief
look at an apocalyptic film, Beasts of the Southern Wild, about a
community living at the edge of climate risk will explore a climateinduced
natural disaster and offer a different ethos than those found in
Enlightenment science apocalypses. (LILLY, 2016, p. 361)

<h3>LILLY, RELIGIÃO, APOCALIPSE</h3>

Known as
“teach the controversy,” some Christian groups fight scientific theory
in public schools by suggesting that their Christian belief-system
presents an alternative theory to explain scientific phenomena. In this
case, the end of the world becomes a battleground between science and
apocalyptic Christian faith. (LILLY, 2016, p. 362)

<h3>LILLY, ILUMINISMO, APOCALIPSE</h3>

Enlightenment science plays an increasingly central role in apocalyptic discourse about climate change. With the rise of pseudo-science, the
authority of the scientist has gotten lost in the dissembling war of
planetary apocalypses. False equivalencies and political rhetoric have
crafted a level playing field in popular culture, where science has—at
least in some circles—lost its privileged place as the arbiter of Truth.
The twentieth century saw the increasing marginalization of
environmentalists and their fervent concerns. (LILLY, 2016, p. 366-367)

<h3>LILLY, ILUMINISMO, COSMOLOGIA</h3>

Enlightenment science has described the structure of the universe in
certain terms: its cosmos is Copernican; its geography, Cartesian; its
time and forces, Newtonian. Students of its revelation must appreciate
how heat exchange, atomic bonding, and pH balance work in order
to understand how they might threaten earth’s systems. Such esoteric
knowledge requires specialized training, a priesthood authorized by
advanced degrees. (LILLY, 2016, p. 368)

<h3>LILLY, IPCC</h3>

The IPCC video presents three phases of climate change: (1) life
before climate change; (2) an apocalyptic climate diagram; and (3) a
culminating message of hope. Ominous music plays over images of a
pre-apocalyptic world. But the video quickly moves into its apocalyptic
climate diagram, communicated through equations, definitions of
terms, and a flowchart. It begins with an equation calculating risk that
uses exploding red bombs to graphically depict scale and probability. (LILLY, 2016, p. 370)

<h3>LILLY, </h3>

To engage the dangers of climate change is to contemplate a rapidly
changing planet. Life depends on numerous natural systems, and
abrupt change could alter how or even whether life can be sustained.
The potential for apocalyptic discourse is obvious. Whether measuring
alarming CO2 levels, crafting rhetoric about the dangers of melting
glaciers, projecting climate models ahead fifty years, or exploring
human experience of natural disasters, apocalyptic discourses function
like a native language for climate change. (LILLY, 2016, p. 377)

<h3>LILLY, </h3>

The potential for crafting apocalypses out of the fodder of climate
change seems as unlimited as the human imagination. Climate change
raises the very biggest questions about human civilization,
interconnectedness, impersonal forces of nature, human culpability,
and human responsibility. (LILLY, 2016, p. 378)
