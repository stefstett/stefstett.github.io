<h3>HUGHES, ZUMBIS, LOCAL, GLOBAL</h3>

Zombie narratives in both literary and cinematic incarnation have moved, likewise, from the local to the global, from the cemetery and the isolated farmhouse to the labyrinthine city and the expansiveness of the sovereign nation – those final two terms, the ascendency implicit in sovereignty and the discrete identities encoded in nationhood being most especially threatened by the undifferentiated and mindless hordes of the revitalized dead. (HUGHES, 2021, p. 08)

<h3>HUGHES, ZUMBIS, PÓS-CULTURA, PERCEPÇÃO </h3>

Zombie fictions thus characteristically depict an undefined and mutable post-culture in which memory is engaged in constant negotiation with perception of the contemporary, and with conception of the future (HUGUES, 2021, p. 08)


<h3>HUGHES, AMBIENTE REVISADO, HUMANIDADE, MONSTRO UNIVERSAL, IDENTIDADE</h3>

It is a revised environment,indeed, in which the very notion of humanity has become,  if not forgotten, then compromised and questionable.3 In this world of competitive rather than collective persistence, survivors from its cultural predecessor are more likely to fight and further reduce the viability of the species than cooperate in order to restore – if not improve upon – the historic and human civilization which has been lost. The zombie – far more than the vampire or the werewolf – thus arguably captures the zeitgeist of a decadent age redolent with consumerism and fearful of consequence, locally hedonistic and yet by implication guilty of a perceptible neglect of literally global proportions. The zombie is a universal monster, uncanny in the Freudian sense, abject in the Kristevan, a contemporary memento mori, which has the capacity to remind us that whatever ‘we’ (the viewer; the reader; civil society) have – be it property, identity, family, wholeness, health, life, intelligence, compassion […] conceptual humanity, even – ‘we’ might easily lose (HUGHES, 2021, p, 08)

<h3>HUGHES, ZUMBIS, COLAPSO ECOLÓGICO</h3>

Indeed, the application of such an approach arguably reveals that, far from being merely a mindless and popular form of gory entertainment, zombie narratives have the capacity to acutely critique essentially the same concerns as the more reputable and elite fictions favoured by the ecocritical establishment. To acknowledge the potency of the zombie as an emblem of ecological collapse is thus, perhaps, to further democratize ecocriticism in expanding its reach into popular fictions, and to
acknowledge that these supposedly ephemeral narratives may successfully convey a sense of environmental crisis to readers located in tabloid rather than broadsheet literacy. (HUGHES, 2021, p. 09)

<h3>HUGHES, TRANSIÇÃO AMBIENTAL, ANTROPOCENO, ZUMBICENO </h3>

Essentially, zombie fiction envisages an environmental transition from the current Anthropocene to – if the neologism may be permitted – a nascent Zombicene, where the consequences of the latter epoch can only be projected in the vaguest of terms. (HUGHES, 2021, p. 09)

<h3>HUGHES, ATIVIDADE HUMANA, ANTROPOCENO, CONSUMISMO</h3>

Human activity in its status as the determining factor of the Anthropocene is the central agent in the impending destruction of humanity through the unending zombie consumerism, which eclipses its mortal counterpart. (HUGHES, 2021, p. 14)
