<h3>STENGERS, INOVAÇÃO, OGM</h3>

In fact, when the public begins
to resist an innovation that scientists have backed, as
notably in the case of GMOs, the usual diagnosis points
to the lack of such understanding. Thus, the public
apparently fails to understand that the genetic modification of plants is not ‘essentially’ different from what
farmers have been doing for millennia, but is just faster
and more effective (STENGERS, 2018, p. 01)
    
<h3>STENGERS, HISTÓRIA DA CIÊNCIA</h3>

Of course, anyone with even a minimal exposure to
the history of science, or to the sciences themselves ‘as
they are made’, can easily conclude that the anonymous
rational being drawing these ‘same conclusions’ is just
the correlate of the ‘rational reconstruction’ of the situation, from which any reason for hesitation has been
purged, and where the facts literally ‘shout out’ the conclusion they lead to with all the authority one could
wish for (STENGERS, 2018, p. 02)
    
<h3>STENGERS, OGM, PESTICIDAS</h3>

 GMOs cultivated across
thousands of hectares raise questions to do with genetic
transfer and pesticide-resistant insects, questions that
can’t be raised at the level of the laboratory, not to
mention issues such as patent applications for modified
plants, the reduction (already critical) of biodiversity, or
the runaway use of pesticides and fertilizer (STENGERS, 2018, p. 03)
    
<h3>STENGERS, INTELIGÊNCIA PÚBLICA, RACIONAL, OBJETIVO</h3>

When we speak of public intelligence, we have to
emphasise first of all that it is not a matter of activists
denouncing, as enemy number one, those biologists who
have presented GMOs as ‘the’ rational and objective
solution to the problem of world hunger. Rather, if a
public intelligence is necessary, it essentially has to do
with the very fact that those scientists were able to take
this kind of position without a care in the world (STENGERS, 2018, p. 04)
    
<h3>STENGERS, INGENUIDADE, CIENTISTAS</h3>

I don’t think that scientists are ‘naive’, like the goose
whose egg we remove from under it in order to give it
a new value for the sake of humankind. They know
perfectly well how to attract the interest of those capable of turning their results into gold (STENGERS, 2018, p. 06)
    
<h3>STENGERS, INTELIGÊNCIA PÚBLICA, DISTANCIAMENTO, ESTADO, INDÚSTRIA, </h3>

If public intelligence on scientific questions has any
meaning, it is in relation to this type of systematic distancing. Scientific institutions, the State and industry
all find their interests converging here. But we should
not be naive about this either. We should not set up,
in opposition to an infantile public in need of comfort, the figure of a thoughtful, reliable public capable
of participating in the things that concern it (STENGERS, 2018, p. 07)
    
<h3>STENGERS, INTELIGÊNCIA PÚBLICA</h3>

It is
not a matter of asking the general question, ‘Does the
public have the capacity?’, but one of asserting that it
doesn’t have the means to be capable. The ‘indifferent
confidence’ of the public (that the scientists feel they
have to protect against doubt) betrays above all the
absence of demanding connoisseurs likely to hold scientists to the task of taking care when making normative
judgements about what does or does not matter, or of
presenting their results in a lucid manner that actively
situates them in relation to the questions they really
can answer, rather than as a response to whatever is
the object of a more general interest (STENGERS, 2018, p. 08)
    
<h3>STENGERS, AGENTES DE RESISTÊNCIA, SABERES SITUADOS</h3>

In other
words, they are able to play a role the crucial character
of which must be recognised by all those who care about
rationality. They are agents of resistance against a scientific knowledge that pretends it has general authority;
they partake in the production of what Donna Haraway
calls ‘situated knowledges’. (STENGERS, 2018, p. 09)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIENTISTAS</h3>

But the scientists will also have to know how to
earn the support that they need, which will not be
the case unless they are capable of hearing and taking
seriously those questions and objections which today
they too often dismiss as opinions that ‘don’t understand the science’ (STENGERS, 2018, p. 10)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CURIOSIDADE</h3>

No surprises there, because by signing up for a ‘hard
science’ degree they have made a choice that is not initially motivated by ‘curiosity’ – or the ‘desire to uncover
the mysteries of the universe’ (most students arriving
with this in mind quickly realise their mistake) – but
by the image of the sciences promoted by the education
system (STENGERS, 2018, p. 11)
    
<h3>STENGERS, ESTUDANTES DE CIÊNCIAS</h3>

It became apparent that the students were interested
in finding things out ‘in the field’, that is, on the Web:
a field constituted by a variety of situations marked by
uncertainty and by the entanglement of what they had
assumed would be separable into ‘facts’ and ‘values’ (STENGERS, 2018, p. 12)
    
<h3>STENGERS, NÃO-CIÊNCIA, IDEOLOGIA</h3>

What indeed
surprised them was the casual way in which scientists
allow themselves to pooh-pooh as ‘non-scientific’ or
‘ideological’ things that others think are important (STENGERS, 2018, p. 13)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CURIOSIDADE, REFLEXÃO CRÍTICA</h3>

 It seems that curiosity, much more than
the critical reflexivity close to the hearts of epistemologists, is what needs to be nourished and freed from
judgements about what does and doesn’t count. Perhaps
this curiosity could bring together students from different fields, allowing them to work together, collectively confronting situations that force them to take a distance
from their respective favourite abstractions, and above
all to overcome two fears: on the one hand, that of
‘hard’ scientists confronted with questions they ‘can’t
deal with’; on the other, that of ‘literary’ or ‘humanities’
specialists faced with the authority of the so-called hard
sciences (STENGERS, 2018, p. 13-14)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIENTISTAS, INTELIGÊNCIA PÚBLICA, FAKE NEWS</h3>

Scientists need such a public intelligence to emerge
not only because they are faced with the now limitless power of their traditional industrial allies, but also
because of another snowballing threat. I just gave the
example of the resource-rich internet, but the internet
is also, of course, a prime vehicle for rumours, conspiracy theories, and the most extravagant ideas (STENGERS, 2018, p. 14)
    
<h3>STENGERS, DOGMATISMO</h3>

If necessary, they will
limit themselves to justifying their research choices via a
few arguments that are sometimes superficial and often
presented with a somewhat dogmatic haste (refining the
arguments would mean wasting valuable time) (STENGERS, 2018, p. 15)
    
<h3>STENGERS, FAKE NEWS</h3>

The current situation is all the more catastrophic
in that the internet audience consists not only of busy
isolated individuals, more or less enlightened and usually sincere, but also of shrewd, paid strategists (STENGERS, 2018, p. 16)
    
<h3>STENGERS, MERCENÁRIOS DA DÚVIDA</h3>

The ‘truths’ targeted by the merchants of doubt are
inconvenient not because of what they contradict but
because of their political and economic consequences.
Scientists then discover, sometimes to their astonishment, that their traditional allies can be relied upon only
when the ‘facts’ help ‘increase productivity’ – when that
isn’t the case, they are open to being transformed into
promoters of unrelenting scepticism (STENGERS, 2018, p. 17)
    
<h3>STENGERS, AUTORIDADE</h3>

That idea of authority has an incontestable relevance
when we are dealing with experimental sciences, but
when it is generalised to ‘field’ sciences, or to any situation that can’t be sufficiently purified to render it
testable and reproducible, a unified facade is created
that is easy to knock down (STENGERS, 2018, p. 17)
    
<h3>STENGERS, MERCENÁRIOS DA DÚVIDA, EVIDÊNCIA CIENTÍFICA</h3>

The merchants of doubt also use the notion of ‘scientific proof’ to attack researchers who, while they do
their best, are implicated in things that have nothing to
do with experimental situations set up to respond to
precise questions (STENGERS, 2018, p. 18)
    
<h3>STENGERS, OPINIÃO, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA</h3>

In the name of the ‘balance of
opinions’ that has to be respected (since in the absence
of a proof there is only opinion), the ‘sceptics’ demand
that their case be heard whenever and wherever the
question of climate change arises. And they have well
and truly succeeded in creating the impression that the
debate is still open, that the scientists really are divided,
and that the dangers are perhaps exaggerated (STENGERS, 2018, p. 18)
    
<h3>STENGERS, PERSPECTIVA, MERCENÁRIOS DA DÚVIDA</h3>

On the contrary, at the risk of
shocking scientists, I don’t think it so crucial that all
inhabitants of the Earth accept the evolutionary perspective as quickly as possible. And it is from this double
point of view that there are grounds for distinguishing
anti-evolutionist doubt from what is currently peddled
by the ‘merchants of doubt’ (STENGERS, 2018, p. 19)
    
<h3>STENGERS, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA</h3>

We know
this already with respect to climate change: as the
Cassandras at the IPCC have warned us, the catastrophic
could well become cataclysmic should we carry on as if
nothing were happening, other than making a few cosmetic adjustments (we often forget that Cassandra was
right). But it also matters for those industries claiming
that, in the absence of certitude, more research is necessary, and that it is better to wait for definite proof (STENGERS, 2018, p. 20)
    
<h3>STENGERS, PLURALIDADE, MERCENÁRIOS DA DÚVIDA</h3>

Yet ignoring this plurality,
and continuing to promote the model of ‘sciences which
prove things’, has given the merchants of doubt the
capacity to attack with impunity (STENGERS, 2018, p. 21)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIENTISTAS CLIMÁTICOS</h3>

What climate scientists in particular
need is a public understanding of what it takes to decipher the climate, mediated by connoisseurs capable of
mobilising against the strategies of their attackers (STENGERS, 2018, p. 21)
    
<h3>STENGERS, TEMPO, CIÊNCIA, CONHECIMENTO</h3>

Here, as elsewhere, time is running out. So it is
worrying to remember that it is now thirty years since
Jean-Marc Lévy-Leblond first raised the alarm, spelling
out how unhealthy it is for science to be incapable of
nourishing the milieus of connoisseurship that are still
today sadly lacking (STENGERS, 2018, p. 22)
    
<h3>STENGERS, AUTORIDADE, SOUND SCIENCE</h3>

We all know that our political and
scientific authorities are concerned about young people’s
lack of interest in the sciences. They are not concerned
about history, sociology or psychology, but about those
sciences that decision-makers in America refer to as
sound. This means both sciences with a proven track
record, and those that are capable of proving things (STENGERS, 2018, p. 23)
    
<h3>STENGERS, VOCAÇÃO, CURIOSIDADE, PROGRESSO</h3>

This talk of a true vocation, symbolised by curiosity,
uncovering the mysteries of the universe, and the benefits brought about by scientific progress, might raise a
smile. But it is this vocation that is advertised to young
people, and especially very young ones. Thinking of the
way in which scientific institutions try to encourage a
taste for the sciences, one could almost speak – dare I
say – of a kind of paedophilia, a thirst to capture the soul of the child (STENGERS, 2018, p. 24-25)
    
<h3>STENGERS, VOCAÇÃO CIENTÍFICA, FEMINISMO</h3>

What defines the scientific vocation, what stuff is a real
researcher made of? It is clearly going to be a gendered
construction in the sense that it has direct discriminatory
effects for most women. One could say that the research
career was designed for men, and even specifically for
men who benefit from the support of women at home
– bringing up children, taking care of practical matters,
allowing them to do all-nighters at the laboratory and go
off on numerous training workshops or on the kind of
overseas trips expected in a research career. In the case
of women, the price paid for such a career is all the more
discriminatory in that judgements as to who counts as
a ‘real researcher’ are part of the very definition of the
vocation. It will often be said of a woman who also has
family responsibilities that the very fact that she chose
to take on such responsibilities shows that perhaps she
never had the ‘stuff’ of a real researcher (STENGERS, 2018, p. 25)
    
<h3>STENGERS, PESQUISADOR DE VERDADE</h3>

On the basis of this hypothesis, to interrogate the stuff
that makes for a ‘real researcher’ (including the women
considered worthy of this title) is to interrogate a construction gifted with a remarkable power because it doesn’t deform reality, but requires a determined insensitivity to the questions posed by that reality. These are
usually expressed in a mode of denial: ‘we know, of
course, but anyway . . .’, and in any case real researchers
have to grit their teeth and ignore such questions (STENGERS, 2018, p. 27-28)
    
<h3>STENGERS, NOSTALGIA</h3>

We have to think in order not to fall into
the trap of a nostalgia for a world which is actually in
the process of collapsing into the past (STENGERS, 2018, p. 29)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIENTISTAS, OBJETIVIDADE</h3>

Scientists, they say, have objectivity as their common
‘worth’, and this might actually be the sole claim that
could bring together practices as diverse as physics, sociology, psychology or history. And yet, it is remarkable
that all attempts by epistemologists to identify the content that would unite these different practices have run
up against banalities devoid of any relevance. In fact, I
would venture to suggest that the only thing that can
bring them together is nothing other than the definition
of opinion as irrational, subjective, malleable and condemned to illusion and appearances (STENGERS, 2018, p. 30)
    
<h3>STENGERS, SABER CIENTÍFICO</h3>

And yet those who have to make decisions complain
about scientific expertise because it is too hesitant for
their taste – it weighs up the issue for and against, muddying the water when what is wanted is a definite answer
‘in the name of science’. The ‘worth’ of the decisionmaker (another unmarked type) lies in knowing that a
line must be drawn (STENGERS, 2018, p. 31)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CRENÇA, DÚVIDA</h3>

Having the right stuff, then, means having faith that
what a scientific question doesn’t make count, doesn’t
count; a faith that defines itself against doubt. He or she
who has been bitten by doubt will not recover the faith
that research requires. Waking up the sleepwalker kills
the researcher (STENGERS, 2018, p. 36)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIENTISTAS, QUESTÕES</h3>

Along the way, enemies will be made of
those who insist that scientists ask themselves certain
questions, or who demand that they give an account of
precisely what it is they are defending in the name of science (STENGERS, 2018, p. 36)
    
<h3>STENGERS, GRANDES QUESTÕES</h3>

 It is no longer for the sake
of ascetic discipline that researchers refrain from asking
‘big questions’, but rather because their training actively
turns them away from such questions. Everything that
might distance them from their discipline has been
excluded, deemed a ‘waste of time’ or, worse, a pathway to doubt. In other words, the phobic, for whom
doubt is the enemy, is first of all the person who has
never learned to take a step sideways, and who therefore
does not know how to slow down without losing their
balance (STENGERS, 2018, p. 38)
    
<h3>STENGERS, OGM, RISCOS, INCERTEZAS</h3>

A recent and striking example is, of course, the claim
of molecular biologists that their strains of genetically modified plants could solve the problem of world
hunger. The gendered dimension was clear in the phobic
contempt with which they dismissed the doubts of their
colleagues who pointed to the socioeconomic reasons
for famine, to social inequalities that were in danger of
widening, to the destruction of agricultural modes of production, or to the difference between laboratory-created
GMOs and those planted on hundreds of thousands
of hectares. In this case, the social scientists and field
scientists were like women with too many sensitivities,
who can speak only of risks and uncertainties (STENGERS, 2018, p. 39)
    
<h3>STENGERS, SLOW SCIENCE</h3>

Besides, it is apparently the case that the first women
primatologists – who didn’t have this worry, having no hope of a career path – invented a ‘slow primatology’,
which was not normalised by advancing the difference
between matters that should interest a scientist and the
seductions of opinion. They allowed themselves to be
affected by the beings with whom they were dealing,
looking for suitable relationships with them, putting the
adventure of shared relevance above the authority of
judgement (STENGERS, 2018, p. 41-42)
    
<h3>STENGERS, MOBILIZAÇÃO</h3>

The women primatologists offer an example
of a research practice where the initial difference was
connected with the fact that they weren’t ‘mobilised’,
i.e. summoned to prove they had the stuff of the ‘real
researcher’. (STENGERS, 2018, p. 42)
    
<h3>STENGERS, MOBILIZAÇÃO, GUERRA</h3>

It is useful to remember that mobilisation is an affair
of men at war. A mobilised army will not slow down
for anything. The only question that matters is, ‘can
we get through?’, and the price that others will pay
for their passing though (ravaged fields, devastated villages) will cause no hesitation. Hesitation and scruples
become synonymous with treason. Of course, scientists who hesitate are not executed, but the submission
of the majority to the mantras that supposedly define
the real researcher is sufficient to establish disciplinary mobilisation, because those who ask disqualified
‘non-scientific’ questions will always be in a minority,
looked on with suspicion (STENGERS, 2018, p. 42)
    
<h3>STENGERS, ESPERANÇA, DESMOBILIZAÇÃO</h3>

So hope does not come easily; but I would like to
introduce an unknown factor into the situation, and let
the idea of the possibility of demobilisation resonate.
The unknown factor is a gendered one, and this time
it has a definitely marked gender, since women have
always been suspected of being seductive or corrupting, inciting honest and courageous men to treason or
desertion.11 This unknown factor takes on a concrete
meaning today, that is, a political one. My conviction
is that the only possibility of ‘saving research’ goes by
way of waking up the sleepwalkers, who will only wake
up if they are compelled to do so. And they will not be
compelled except by demands that rejig the question
of what can or should be expected of researchers, by
new requirements prohibiting them from adopting an
attitude of denial when faced with questions that ‘real’
researchers have not been supposed to ask themselves (STENGERS, 2018, p. 43)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CONSCIÊNCIA, CONSEQUÊNCIAS, BOA CIÊNCIA</h3>

It is not a matter of an appeal for science to discover
a conscience, or for researchers to take responsibility
for the consequences of the innovations in which their
research has participated. Nor is it a matter of opposing
‘good science’, serving genuine collective interests, to
science biased by its service of private interests. In both
cases, scientific knowledge still arrogates the crucial
position of serving an interest that transcends particular passions (STENGERS, 2018, p. 45)
    
<h3>STENGERS, AUTONOMIA, AUTORIDADES POLÍTICAS</h3>

Today, publicly financed research is in the process of
losing its autonomy. Researchers feel that they have
been ‘betrayed’ by the political authorities, who, instead
of respecting a consensually recognised right, have given
corporations the power to select who among them will
benefit from public sponsorship in every field where economic competition is in play (STENGERS, 2018, p. 48)
    
<h3>STENGERS, COMPETIÇÃO, RECONHECIMENTO</h3>

As it happens, in the field of research, competition
for the recognition of ‘excellence’, which has become
a condition for academic survival, puts into play that
rare resource which is publication in a top-ranking journal. This condition for publication thus demands that
researchers pitch their research on the basis of what
these journals impose in terms of norms: conformity,
opportunism and flexibility – such is the formula for
excellence (STENGERS, 2018, p. 49)
    
<h3>STENGERS, PUBLICAÇÕES, PEER REVIEW</h3>

 They discover that they
must avoid publishing in minor journals dedicated to
their type of research, and instead ‘have to’ publish in
major journals, the criteria of which thus determine the
value of their research. Before commenting upon this
situation, I’d like to emphasise how insular specialised
scientific journals are anyway, where articles are submitted to ‘referees’ chosen from among peers, that is,
‘competent colleagues’, and then read, in general, only
by such colleagues. This peculiarity stems directly from
the functioning of the ‘modern sciences’ themselves,
where evaluation is immanent to the community, a community in which authors are read by other authors who
assume the key role of taking into account, extending or
contesting what they have read (STENGERS, 2018, p. 50)
    
<h3>STENGERS, QUALIDADE, REDUÇÃO, PUBLICAÇÕES</h3>

So it is easy to understand that, for those still attached to research quality, one of the first ways to push back,
apart from contesting the ranking of journals, is to slow
down the number of publications and to insist that
referees take the time to judge whether an argument
is well-made or if it represents only a partial result,
without intrinsic interest, hastily published to get a few
points (STENGERS, 2018, p. 51-52)
    
<h3>STENGERS, FAST SCIENCES</h3>

What I want to demonstrate here is that this model
has been invented for the ‘fast’ sciences, with their strict
differentiation between the cumulative production of
knowledge addressed only to competent colleagues, and
‘vulgarised’ forms of knowledge (STENGERS, 2018, p. 52)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CAPTURA, INDÚSTRIA</h3>

Capture can happen in a great variety of ways,
according to the ability of those-to-be-captured to frame
their own conditions. At one extreme, there is industry,
with its researchers working in over-equipped laboratories, and with lawyers, marketing teams, etc. The
projected capture of its interest implies a consequential
transformation of the scientific proposal, with a mass of
grey literature, most often protected as commercial-inconfidence. At the other extreme, there is the ‘general
public’, to whom scientists of good will – devoting
part of their precious time to this charity work – will
explain how ‘science’ is now capable of responding to
their preoccupations and the questions they want to ask,
including even those that Man has asked himself from
the very beginning (STENGERS, 2018, p. 54)
    
<h3>STENGERS, FAST SCIENCE, FILOSOFIA, DELEUZE, PUBLICAÇÕES</h3>

Let us now leave the experimental sciences, where
the fast science model was invented, in order to pause
for a moment at the opposite extreme, with the production of a knowledge which is not science: philosophy.
And let us take the case of a well-known philosopher,
Gilles Deleuze. How would he be evaluated? His citation count in the top philosophy journals (generally of
the analytical persuasion) would be weak. As for his productivity, it would be judged derisory because he did
not publish many articles, and most that he did publish
appeared in journals that don’t count. As for his books,
they don’t count either – a book is ‘outside evaluation’
because a ‘real researcher’ publishes for his colleagues,
within the bounds imposed by referees (STENGERS, 2018, p. 55-56)
    
<h3>STENGERS, PLURALIDADE</h3>

Instituting a plurality of sciences against the unity
of ‘Science’ means treating this unity as an amalgam
that has to be dissolved in order to free the different
ingredients in their particularity. Dissolving an amalgam doesn’t involve passing judgement, but rather
doing away with pseudo-similarities (STENGERS, 2018, p. 59)
    
<h3>STENGERS, PLURALIDADE</h3>

The question of the plurality of the sciences can only
be raised after this first amalgam is dissolved, when the
argument ‘you have to accept this hypothesis, otherwise we can no longer define our object in a scientific
manner’ is referred to the imperative of objectivation
proper to the cameral sciences (STENGERS, 2018, p. 61)
    
<h3>STENGERS, PLURALIDADE, CIÊNCIAS MODERNAS</h3>

And then comes the
question of plurality: if we turn to those sciences that,
unlike the cameral sciences, can be said to be ‘modern’,
how can we dissolve a second amalgam produced, this
time, by the injunction to establish ‘facts’ authorising an
interpretation that will be said to be ‘objective’? (STENGERS, 2018, p. 62)
    
<h3>STENGERS, HARD SCIENCES, SOFT SCIENCES</h3>

From this last point of view, we can sketch another
way of speaking about the contrast between the so-called
‘hard’ and ‘soft’ sciences. A priori, the questions put by
‘hard’ science only interest competent colleagues – hence,
by the way, the need to solicit the interest of the ‘public’
(vulgarisation) and of those who can draw ‘non-scientific’ consequences (‘benefits’) from their propositions (STENGERS, 2018, p. 63)
    
<h3>STENGERS, PRAGMATISMO, VISÃO CIENTÍFICA, QUESTÕES CORRETAS</h3>

A perspective that can be called ‘pragmatic’ could then
be substituted for the notion of a ‘scientific vision’ of the
world conceived on the model of what is demanded
by experimental success: a world fundamentally indifferent, certainly complicated, but proposing only one
type of success, i.e. the discovery of the ‘right point of
view’ that allows the ‘right questions’ to be asked, on
the basis of which the jumble of empirical observations
become intelligible (STENGERS, 2018, p. 64)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIÊNCIAS MODERNAS, RELAÇÕES</h3>

In the case of what I am calling the ‘modern
sciences’, we are dealing with collective practices that
assemble ‘competent colleagues’ around the question of
the kinds of relationships that will allow them to learn
from what they are studying (STENGERS, 2018, p. 65)
    
<h3>STENGERS, LATOUR, CIÊNCIAS EXPERIMENTAIS</h3>

This is why Bruno Latour, apropos the social sciences,
suggested that critical social scientists committed a felix
culpa, a mistake with fortunate consequences, when
they took as their target practitioners of experimental
sciences who protested violently.4 They felt insulted
when asked questions that didn’t take into account what
mattered to them: their success in conferring on their
facts the power to make them all agree (STENGERS, 2018, p. 65)
    
<h3>STENGERS, SOFT SCIENCES, GALILEU</h3>

Here we are dealing with what is used as an argument
for the ‘soft’ sciences: the difference between humans
and the spheres rolling along Galileo’s inclined plane
that confirmed his doveria. And it is true that scientific
practices that try to get around this difference are literally haunted by it: really spooked by the possibility
that their subjects might understand how they ‘should’
respond. Particularly in experimental psychology, the
interest that subjects take in the knowledge produced
about them becomes a real curse, since what is being
studied should be a ‘behaviour’ that is indifferent to
the meaning of the question asked of it (STENGERS, 2018, p. 67)
    
<h3>STENGERS, GALILEU, FAST SCIENCES</h3>

 his world, where
academic institutions have taken the research practices
of the fast sciences and their competent colleagues as
exemplary, anyone mimicking those sciences will always
be at an advantage. It goes without saying that objective
evaluation is dedicated to transforming this advantage
into hegemony, pure and simple (STENGERS, 2018, p. 68)
    
<h3>STENGERS, VIVEIROS DE CASTRO, DECOLONIZAÇÃO DO PENSAMENTO</h3>

This is what Eduardo Vivieros de
Castro calls a ‘decolonisation of thought’ process, but
my approach leads me to think of it without any connotations of blame or heroism, and rather in terms of
apprenticeship – the ethnologist can certainly keep at
the forefront of her mind the dense relation between
ethnology and colonialism, but this is not what will
make her capable of learning from those who agree to
welcome her in (STENGERS, 2018, p. 69)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIÊNCIA, VALORES</h3>

But it is above all the way in which the ‘science’
amalgam enters into conflict with what makes a science
fruitful that we can feel other values pushing forward,
values other than that of ‘facts that prove’, introducing other ways of evaluating (STENGERS, 2018, p. 70)
    
<h3>STENGERS, NARRAÇÃO, FATOS</h3>

As elsewhere, questions of how to ‘narrate well’ are multiplied,
refined and dialogical, but nowhere else are they as stifled by a machine that reduces all of history to ‘facts’
that monotonously witness to the same truth: natural
selection. But it is not just the histories told by evolutionary biologists that become ‘matters of proof’.6 From
ethology to the human sciences, ‘real science’ publishes
in prestigious journals ‘facts’ that are extracted in a
brutal way from their contexts and interpreted as attesting (without, of course, the least ‘it should’ or ‘but then
. . .’) to the general explanatory power of selection, set
against the illusions of their ‘backward’ colleagues who
are ‘still’ looking for other ways of learning (STENGERS, 2018, p. 70)
    
<h3>STENGERS, ETOLOGIA, CIENTIFICIDADE</h3>

Even where ethology is defined by a method that
assures its ‘scientificity’, the norms censuring everything
that might be suspected of anthropomorphism have lost
their stability.7 If a prestigious team dares to take seriously a question that had previously been laughed at,
and a well-known journal publishes their results, this is
now sufficient to lift the taboo, and teams of researchers
rush through the open door (STENGERS, 2018, p. 71)
    
<h3>STENGERS, COMPARTIMENTALIZAÇÃO, CONHECIMENTO, CIÊNCIA MODERNA</h3>

It goes without saying that meticulous and delicate
thinkers will find much to criticise in the preceding
descriptions. And it has to be said they are not descriptions at all, but a somewhat brutal attempt to shake up
our routines, such as the idea that, aside from the ritual
complaints about research being too compartmentalised, or the need for inter- or trans-disciplinarity, our
research institutes, before their recent dismantling, were
a first approximation of a healthy division of labour corresponding to the zealous obligation to advance
knowledge. More precisely, mine is a thought experiment
responding in the end to a simple enough hypothesis:
namely, that the type of knowledge associated with the
notion of modern science would have the very peculiar
feature of not being first and foremost discursive, fitted
with ‘and therefores’ that allow one to move from one
statement to the next (STENGERS, 2018, p. 71-72)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CAPACIDADE DAS CIÊNCIAS </h3>

I wanted to generate the thought, and the feeling,
that we have no idea what our sciences might be capable
of, or could have become capable of in a slightly different world, where the value of what a scientist ‘reports’,
as evaluated by her competent colleagues, communicates with a new kind of realism (STENGERS, 2018, p. 72)
    
<h3>STENGERS, VALORIZAÇÃO, CONHECIMENTO CIENTÍFICO, SIMBIOSE</h3>

And yet, what we call ‘valorisation’ – scientific
knowledge being valued for reasons other than its contribution to the ‘advance of knowledge’ – must certainly
escape the twin models of experimental and cameral sciences, while at the same time permitting us to describe
these models as particular cases. Here I shall employ the
notion of symbiosis as a joining of heterogeneous beings
– where each has its respective world matter in heterogeneous ways, from which each benefits, or which each
valorises, in its own way (STENGERS, 2018, p. 73)
    
<h3>STENGERS, SIMBIOSE, CIÊNCIA, INDÚSTRIA</h3>

The symbiosis between science and technical-industrial
innovation has now flipped into a straightforward relation of capture. But as we have seen (and this theme will
be amplified in the two following chapters), it was characterised for quite a while by a radical reduction in the
number of protagonists allowed to assess the ‘value’ of
scientific propositions (STENGERS, 2018, p. 74)
    
<h3>STENGERS, REDUÇÃO</h3>

In this perspective, the idea of ‘slowing down’
the sciences communicates with the question of how
scientists might be trained to take part in such slowing
down, notably by challenging all those modes of appreciation and judgement through which they are supposed
to take on board their duty ‘not to waste their time’ (STENGERS, 2018, p. 74)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIÊNCIAS SOCIAIS, SIMBIOSE, ANTAGONISMO</h3>

So the
social sciences would be in a symbiotic relationship with
processes through which groups become capable of formulating their own problems. And it is here that one is
tempted to think in antagonistic terms about our relation to State reason, or what is today called the practice
of (good) governance. I would like to try to think about
this antagonism in non-essentialist terms, as resulting
from an operation of capture, which thus also implies
that there is, or was, a possibility of symbiosis (STENGERS, 2018, p. 75)
    
<h3>STENGERS, AVALIAÇÃO, EMPODERAMENTO</h3>

Let me be quite clear. When we ask the question, ‘How
do we want to be evaluated?’, it is a real test requiring
the collective dynamic of empowerment that I associated
above with democracy.8 And it is obviously here that
the social sciences could both learn and valorise their
knowledge in an environment where that knowledge
would not be an authority but a resource – not ‘against’
governance, but in a way that activates possibilities for
resisting cameral capture. The link between the social
sciences and the State would be neither antagonistic nor
collaborative, just a link as precarious as the very definition of a ‘democratic State’. It would unify two ways of
making things matter, each being the other’s nightmare
in its own way (STENGERS, 2018, p. 76)
    
<h3>STENGERS, SIMBIOSE, FORÇAS PRODUTIVAS, EXTRAÇÃO</h3>

Here again, the model of symbiosis between the
research laboratory and the ‘development of productive
forces’ is a bad one. This does not mean at all that the
idea of extraction should be proscribed in itself. The
sciences function through extraction, through a process
of apprenticeship in which something implanted in one
place is extracted and reported to others for whom it
will make sense. What poses the problem is the way in
which extraction and modernisation have been linked,
transforming the question, ‘What can we learn here?’,
into a principle of judgement that identifies what has
been extracted with what really matters, and relegates
the rest to an overlay of beliefs and parasitical habits (STENGERS, 2018, p. 79)
    
<h3>STENGERS, COLONIALISMO, RECURSOS, CRENÇA, CONHECIMENTO</h3>

If what makes the
other exist in their proper consistency is what permits
their recalcitrance, and if recalcitrance is a condition for
the apprenticeship towards relevance, then the dream
in question relates not to the adventure of the modern
sciences, but to the happy times of colonialism, when the people were, along with everything else, resources
from which we had to extract whatever would allow us
to ‘progress’, and, as it happens, to say ‘they believe, but
we know’ (STENGERS, 2018, p. 80)
    
<h3>STENGERS, LENTIDÃO</h3>

The right to ‘slowness’ is not an end in itself, nor does it
refer to the way some researchers ask to be ‘left alone’
so they can continue to think of themselves as entitled
to privileged treatment (STENGERS, 2018, p. 80)
    
<h3>STENGERS, RECLAIMING</h3>

To speak of destruction is to speak of a resistance that
can only exist alongside what American activists call
‘reclaiming’ – recuperating, healing, becoming capable
once again of linking with what we have been separated from. This ‘recuperation’ process always begins
with the jolting realisation that we are well and truly
sick, and have been for a long time, so long that we no
longer recognise what we are lacking, and think of our
sickness, and whatever sustains it, as ‘normal’ (STENGERS, 2018, p. 81)
    
<h3>STENGERS, LENTIDÃO, FRICÇÕES</h3>

It is
here that the word ‘slow’, as used in the slow movements,
is adequate. Speed demands and creates an insensitivity
to everything that might slow things down: the frictions,
the rubbing, the hesitations that make us feel we are
not alone in the world (STENGERS, 2018, p. 81)
    
<h3>STENGERS, RELAÇÕES</h3>

It means, therefore, creating among us and with
others the kind of relation that works for sick people,
people who need each other in order to learn – with
others, from others, thanks to others – what a life worth
living demands, and the knowledges that are worth
being cultivated (STENGERS, 2018, p. 81)
    
<h3>STENGERS, FILOSOFIA, PRODUÇÃO, QUESTÕES CIENTÍFICAS</h3>

In fact, I turned to philosophy precisely because I felt
unable to comply with the strict division between the
productive, scientific questions and the ‘idle’ ones, or
those that concern the philosophers (STENGERS, 2018, p. 84)
    
<h3>STENGERS, KUHN, PARADIGMA, FATOS NEUTROS</h3>

The first collective to react was, of course, that of
philosophers of science, who were scandalised by
Kuhn’s claim that paradigms were incommensurable.
The idea that there are no neutral facts to support a
comparison between rival paradigms was perceived as
an offence against their own self-appointed role as the
keepers of scientific rationality, as those whose task it is
to extract, and think with, the rational norms that must
be respected in order to ensure the progress of scientific
knowledge (STENGERS, 2018, p. 85)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIÊNCIA COMO PRÁTICA SOCIAL</h3>

In the 1980s, however, new thought collectives entered
the scene. Each had a distinct agenda, but they shared a
common concern. Whether they were critical theorists,
feminists, specialists in post-colonial studies or in a new
brand of sociology of science, they considered it crucial
for their agenda to show that the sciences were a social
practice like any other (STENGERS, 2018, p. 86)
    
<h3>STENGERS, KUHN, PARADIGMA, CONHECIMENTO, CONSTRUÇÃO SOCIAL</h3>

So, Kuhn’s paradigms became the royal road towards
an inclusive, relativist understanding of the sciences,
demoting their universalist claims. If even a science like
physics had no privileged access to a reality able to force
agreement onto every rational person, then it followed
that all knowledge must be a social construction (STENGERS, 2018, p. 86)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIENTISTAS, KUHN, PARADIGMA</h3>

Scientists like myself, who endorsed Kuhn’s description, at first saw the rabbit of the radical distinction
between paradigmatic and non- or pre-paradigmatic sciences, which explained for them how their own sciences
benefited cumulative progress, while other modern
sciences, try as they might to mimic this, could not
achieve it. But then they discovered the relativist duck
empowering their enemies (STENGERS, 2018, p. 87)
    
<h3>STENGERS, REVOLUÇÃO CIENTÍFICA, KUHN, ANOMALIA</h3>

For these rabbit readers the very existence of insistent and resilient anomalies that often play a crucial role
at the outset of a scientific revolution is proof enough
that Kuhn was not placing interpretation at a vantage
point where it has unilateral control. There would be
no anomaly if experimentation could force interpretation onto a mute or confused situation (STENGERS, 2018, p. 88)
    
<h3>STENGERS, OBJETIVIDADE</h3>

In the first case, objectivity is defined as a collective
achievement that requires cooperation, implying that
objections are a positive, even necessary and called for,
part of the collective game. In the second, each individual work attracts a rather suspicious, censorial mode
of attention. Here collective interaction is about the correct application of the method, with no special interest
in the facts themselves, each being added like a brick to
an edifice rather than assessed in terms of the new possibilities or questions it allows us to envisage (STENGERS, 2018, p. 93)
    
<h3>STENGERS, FATOS, FLECK, KUHN</h3>

We face a future where claimed ‘facts’ will accumulate
at full speed but nobody will really know what is meant
by a ‘fact’ any longer, be it a Fleckian or a Kuhnian one (STENGERS, 2018, p. 97)
    
<h3>STENGERS, KUHN, FLECK</h3>

For Fleck, as I have
mentioned, it is difficult to pay attention to, or be aware
of, the particularity of one’s own thought-style and the
way it selects and discards aspects of a situation which
‘do not really matter’, but the difficulty is an empirical
fact only. For Kuhn, ignoring this particularity is crucial
for the tenacious creativity of the puzzle-solver. In other
words (STENGERS, 2018, p. 99)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIÊNCIA LENTA</h3>

But slow science is not about scientists taking full
account of the messy complications of the world. It is
about them facing up to the challenge of developing a
collective awareness of the particularity and selective
character of their own thought-style. This, however,
should not be confused with a call for lucid reflexivity to be developed inside thought collectives. It is
rather a matter of collective learning through the test
of an encounter with dissenting voices around issues of
common interest (STENGERS, 2018, p. 100)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIENTISTAS CIVILIZADOS</h3>

Civilised scientists would make it public, a matter of
exoteric knowledge, that the reliability of their results
is related to matters of concern as well as to competent knowledge; and that the very particular conditions
required by the latter come at the price of ignoring what
may be important factors outside the laboratory (STENGERS, 2018, p. 101)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CONFIANÇA, VALORIZAÇÃO</h3>

In other words, civilised scientists, true to the specificity of their practice, will insist that reliability is not
a stable attribute, and that the ‘valorisation’ of a possibility born inside a research environment requires a
radical redistribution of expertise through the creation
of demanding new relations that will give voice to the
often messy web of hard questions that matter in any
given situation (STENGERS, 2018, p. 102)
    
<h3>STENGERS, REDISTRIBUIÇÃO, CONHECIMENTO</h3>

Such a redistribution cannot be thought of in terms of
the contrast between exoteric and esoteric knowledge.
Rather, it demands that the situation be understood
through the diverse matters of concern that connect
with it, with no a priori differentiation between what
really matters and what doesn’t (STENGERS, 2018, p. 102)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIENTISTAS CIVILIZADOS, VALORES </h3>

Civilised scientists are not, however, scientists with
a general culture. What they have to cultivate is the
capacity to participate in the collective assessment of
the consequences of an innovation, rather than a decision based on values (STENGERS, 2018, p. 103)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIÊNCIA LENTA, MOBILIZAÇÃO, SIMBIOSE</h3>

Slow science thus represents not only a challenge to
fast, mobilised science. It is also a wager. A wager on
the capacity of scientific thought collectives to enter
into new symbiotic relations with other collectives that have different matters of concern. The very term ‘slow’
is indicative of this wager (STENGERS, 2018, p. 103-104)
    
<h3>STENGERS, ECONOMIA DO CONHECIMENTO, COMPETIÇÃO</h3>

I am not speaking here only of the knowledge economy and the imperative to produce knowledge that is of
interest to the competitive war-games of the corporate
world. Even those academic fields that don’t produce
patents have now been submitted to the general imperative of benchmark evaluation (STENGERS, 2018, p. 107)
    
<h3>STENGERS, ACADEMIA</h3>

Ten years
ago I was ready to admit it was a dying institution,
richly deserving its fate. Today, however, this destruction can be seen, along with innumerable other such
destructions, as systematically eradicating resources that
could address the future, and systematically cutting off
our capacity to think, that is, to escape despair and
cynicism. One way or another, much of what is being
destroyed may be characterised, like the academy, as
deserving of its fate, but the meaning of such a characterisation has changed. It has become a way of refusing
the challenge we are confronted by (STENGERS, 2018, p. 108)
    
<h3>STENGERS, BARBARIDADE</h3>

Accepting that one must think, feel and imagine the
necessity of facing up to barbarism means refusing the
idea that other, more deserving figures will arrive to turn
the tables (STENGERS, 2018, p. 109)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIENTISTAS</h3>

As we saw there, it concludes by asking
an unspecified audience to leave scientists alone: ‘We
cannot continuously tell you what our science means;
what it will be good for; because we simply don’t know
yet. Science needs time – Bear with us, while we think.’ (STENGERS, 2018, p. 109)
    
<h3>STENGERS, UNIVERSIDADE, CRIAÇÃO DE FUTURO, WHITEHEAD</h3>

‘The task of a university is
the creation of the future, so far as rational thought, and
civilised modes of appreciation, can affect the issue. The
future is big with every possibility of achievement and
of tragedy.’ [whitehead] (STENGERS, 2018, p. 109)
    
<h3>STENGERS, ACADÊMICOS, PASSADO</h3>

Those academics who just
ask for time to think – who do not name those putting
pressure on them, preferring to address ‘society’ and
ask for protection – do not feel there is an option at all.
They just dream of a past where they, and the so-called
disinterested knowledge they produced, were respected (STENGERS, 2018, p. 110)
    
<h3>STENGERS, FUTURO</h3>

We do not
know what our future will be, and nor do we know if,
or to what extent, what he calls rational thought and
civilised modes of appreciation can affect the issue. But
this is why his proposition is relevant today, more than
ever (STENGERS, 2018, p. 110)
    
<h3>STENGERS, WHITEHEAD, UNIVERSIDADE, CIÊNCIA LENTA</h3>

Whitehead’s plea regarding
the task of universities was thus also aimed at a ‘slowing
down’ of science, which is the necessary condition for
thinking with abstractions rather than obeying them (STENGERS, 2018, p. 112)
    
<h3>STENGERS, LIEBIG, QUÍMICA RÁPIDA, ACADEMIA, SIMBIOSE</h3>

Liebig’s invention of what we may call ‘fast chemistry’ entailed a cut, which divided not pure and applied
chemistry, but rather the whole continent of chemical
crafts on the one side, and, on the other, both academic
research and the new network of industrial chemistry,
the two entertaining a new symbiotic relation, as each
needed and fed the other (STENGERS, 2018, p. 113)
    
<h3>STENGERS, INDÚSTRIA, ACADEMIA, PESQUISA</h3>

 it is in its own best interest that industry should keep its distance from academic research,
leaving the scientific community free to determine its
own questions, because only scientists can tell, at each
step, which questions will be fruitful, which will lead to
fast cumulative development and which will result only
in some empirical gathering of facts leading nowhere.
For industry to dictate its own questions would be like
killing the goose and losing the eggs (STENGERS, 2018, p. 113)
    
<h3>STENGERS, DIVISÃO, CLASSE, ACADEMIA, INDÚSTRIA</h3>

The first one is the division, a true
class division, between scientists who work on protected
academic territory and those who, in selling their labour
power to industry, are usually denied autonomy and the
freedom to contribute to public knowledge. The second
aspect is that the goose with the golden egg metaphor
hides an important feature of the role the trained scientist now plays as a fast science professional (STENGERS, 2018, p. 114)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIENTISTAS, </h3>

Asking
creative scientists to be actively concerned about the
consequences of their work would be the equivalent
of waking the sleepwalkers, making them aware that
the world is a long way from obeying their categories.
Struck by doubt, they would fall from the ridge into the
morass of turbid opinions. They would, that is, be lost
for science (STENGERS, 2018, p. 114)
    
<h3>STENGERS, WHITEHEAD, MOBILIZAÇÃO, EXÉRCITO</h3>

What Whitehead called the training of professionals rather refers to the kind of induced
anaesthesia generated by a mobilised army on the move,
where the imperative is to go as fast as possible. Such
an army does not wander and wonder (STENGERS, 2018, p. 115)
    
<h3>STENGERS, OGM, FOME MUNDIAL, CIENTISTAS</h3>

From this point of view, biologists defending GMOs, for instance, may feel quite justified in claiming to have
found a rational solution to the problem of feeding the
hungry, quietly ignoring the social and economic causes
of world hunger. They just show themselves to be real
scientists, ignoring everything that would slow them
down or put obstacles in the way of the progress made
possible by their golden eggs. (STENGERS, 2018, p. 115-116)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIÊNCIA RÁPIDA, AMBIENTE, </h3>

What characterises fast science is not isolation, but rather working in a
very rarefied environment, an environment divided into
allies who matter and those who, whatever their concerns and protests, have to recognise that they are the
ultimate recipients of the golden benefits, and therefore
should not disturb the progress of science (STENGERS, 2018, p. 116)
    
<h3>STENGERS, RESPONSABILIDADE, CIÊNCIA RÁPIDA, SITUADA</h3>

The
reliability of fast science’s results is relative to purified,
well-controlled laboratory experiments. And competent objections are competent only with regard to such
controlled environments. Which means that scientific
reliability is situated, bound, to the constraints of its
production (STENGERS, 2018, p. 118)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIÊNCIA LENTA</h3>

But slow science is not – emphatically not – about
the goose becoming an omniscient intelligence, able to
envisage the consequences of the innovations her science
makes possible (STENGERS, 2018, p. 120)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIÊNCIA LENTA, BAGUNÇADO</h3>

This may be the challenge that slow science should
answer, enabling scientists to accept that what is messy
is not defective but simply that which we have to learn
to live in and think with (STENGERS, 2018, p. 120)
    
<h3>STENGERS, BAGUNÇA, CIÊNCIA LENTA, RECLAIM</h3>

But in ignoring messiness,
and dreaming of its eradication, we discover that we
have messed up our world. So I would characterise slow
science as the demanding operation that would reclaim
the art of dealing with, and learning from, what scientists too often consider messy, that is, what escapes
general, so-called objective, categories (STENGERS, 2018, p. 120)
    
<h3>STENGERS, RECLAIMING</h3>

The term ‘reclaiming’, as used by US activists, refers
to healing operations that would reappropriate what
we have been separated from, recovering or reinventing
what that separation has destroyed. Reclaiming always
begins by accepting that we are sick rather than guilty,
and understanding how our environment makes us sick (STENGERS, 2018, p. 121)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIENTISTAS, ACADÊMICOS, MODERNOS</h3>

It may well be that if we had to tell the tale of how
scientists and academics were unable to defend the conditions that allow them to exist, we would have to relate
how they were finally the victims of the lie that made
them modern, allowing them to claim a general authority while the specificity of their practice receded into the
background (STENGERS, 2018, p. 121)
    
<h3>STENGERS, RECLAIMING, PESQUISA, MUNDO BAGUNÇADO, WHITEHEAD</h3>

If reclaiming
scientific research means re-embedding the sciences in
a messy world, it is not only a question of accepting
this world as such, but of positively appreciating it, of
learning how to foster and strengthen, in Whitehead’s
words, ‘the habits of concrete appreciation of the individual facts in their full interplay of emergent values’ (STENGERS, 2018, p. 122)
    
<h3>STENGERS, TÉDIO, AUTORIDADE</h3>

Think also of the boredom we are all so used to,
silently and patiently half-listening to a dear colleague
speaking for an hour. We have our departments of psychology, social psychology, pedagogy and so on, but
we have not learned even a fraction of what activists
engaged in reclaiming operations have to learn when
they want to work together with others without asserting their authority (STENGERS, 2018, p. 123)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CATEGORIAS</h3>

Moments at which values
emerge cannot be disembedded and submitted to general categories; for instance, the moment when someone
feels transformed by having understood someone else’s
perspective; or the gathering that discovers the transformative power of its participants thinking together; or
the experience that something which until now appeared
insignificant may indeed matter (STENGERS, 2018, p. 123)
    
<h3>STENGERS, RECLAIMING, CIÊNCIA, RESPOSTA PRONTA, ACADÊMICOS</h3>

Again, reclaiming means first of all recognising that
we are sick and need to heal. Slow science does not
provide a ready-made answer; it is not a pill. It is the
name for a movement in which many paths to recovery
might come together. As for us academics, what about
introducing slow meetings, that is, meetings organised
in such a way that participation is not only formal? (STENGERS, 2018, p. 124)
    
<h3>STENGERS, MOBILIZAÇÃO, CIENTISTAS, REPENSAR, REINVENTAR, FILOSOFIA</h3>

Challenging mobilisation – which divorces scientists
from their power to think, imagine and connect, which
defines whatever would slow them down as necessarily
secondary since what would be slowed down is progress
– entails rethinking and reinventing scientific institutions. But I want now to approach the question from
another angle, not pre-empting this reinvention, which
is not my task as a philosopher, but activating another
complementary imagination, which concerns those
academic fields without any golden eggs, namely, the
humanities (STENGERS, 2018, p. 125)
    
<h3>STENGERS, WHITEHEAD, UNIVERSIDADE, CRIAÇÃO DE FUTURO</h3>

Whitehead, as I quoted him above, defined the task
of the university as the creation of the future, so far
as rational thought, and civilised modes of appreciation, can affect the issue. Critical reflexivity, to put it
in a nutshell, does not seem to me to be engaged by
the question of how its own interventions are liable
to ‘affect the issue’ (STENGERS, 2018, p. 126)
    
<h3>STENGERS, RECLAIMING, MOBILIZAÇÃO, WHITEHEAD, REFLEXIVIDADE, ECOLOGIA DE CONEXÕES PARCIAIS</h3>

Reclaiming rational thought from mobilisation, and
reclaiming civilised modes of appreciation from their
temptation to contrast themselves with others who need
enlightenment (whatever light an academic field claims
to provide), are clearly not enough. We also have to
reclaim the unknown that figures in Whitehead’s definition: ‘so far as [what we thus reclaim] can affect the
issue’, that is, can affect other struggles aimed at the creation of a future worth living. This, I would argue, is not
a matter of reflexivity. It rather demands what I would
call an ‘ecology of partial connections’, which requires
learning from others, being transformed by what is
learned, and acknowledging our debt to this transformative experience as we explore its problematising impacts
in our own terms (STENGERS, 2018, p. 127)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CONEXÕES PARCIAIS, SITUADO</h3>

Making partial connections means first of all accepting being situated (STENGERS, 2018, p. 127)
    
<h3>STENGERS, RECLAIM, REALIDADE </h3>

The test here may well be whether we can reclaim,
for those ideas that make us feel and think, the capacity
to ‘add’ something to reality, rather than considering
ideas and knowledge in terms of truth, explanation or
objectivity (STENGERS, 2018, p. 128)
    
<h3>STENGERS, HARAWAY, RESPONSABILIDADE</h3>

This is a testing question indeed: demanding, as
Haraway expresses it, that one consent to ‘responsibility’ in her sense of the term; accepting that what we add
makes a difference to the world and becoming able to
answer for the manner of this difference. How, in so
doing, do we cast our lot for some ways of life and not
others? (STENGERS, 2018, p. 128)
    
<h3>STENGERS, PRIVILÉGIOS</h3>

Far from struggling to retain our
ancient privileges, we should dare to think with the
possibility that we are able to make worthy additions
to the weaving of situations that will enable resistance
against the coming barbarism. And this may well be the
most demanding version of what I called, with James,
a genuine option, the challenge to consent or to evade (STENGERS, 2018, p. 129)
    
<h3>STENGERS, MUDANÇA</h3>

The reclaiming witches’ ritual chant –
‘She changes everything She touches, and everything She
touches changes’ – could surely be commented on in
terms of assemblages crafted to resist the dismembering attribution of agency. Does change belong to the
goddess as ‘agent’ or to the one who changes when
touched? But the first efficacy of the refrain is in the ‘She
touches’. Resisting dismemberment is not conceptual (STENGERS, 2018, p. 130)
    
<h3>STENGERS, RECLAIM, MUDANÇA, ACADEMIA</h3>

Whatever way we may reclaim
the capacity to honour change, it must resist the pressure inside academia: that of our dear colleagues who
will object that we are not being objective or critical
enough, or of journals that insist on the need to respect
their norms, the need to begin by expounding ‘Materials
and Methods’ (or the Literature Review!) (STENGERS, 2018, p. 131)
    
<h3>STENGERS, INFECTADOS</h3>

Again, recognising that we are infected and may be
spreading the infection is not a matter of guilt to be
atoned for, but of learning how to create means of
protection. We have to learn, as the witches did, how
to cast circles that protect us from our insalubrious,
infectious milieu without isolating us from the work
to be done, from the concrete situations that need to
be confronted (STENGERS, 2018, p. 131)
    
<h3>STENGERS, GAIA, POSSIBILIDADE, PRÁTICAS CIVILIZATÓRIAS MODERNAS</h3>

The absent word is a name: Gaia.
And yet it is with Gaia that I would like to begin, because
it is her intrusion that places me in my current position. She forces me to evoke a possibility that could be
rejected twice, and quite rightly. The very idea of ‘civilising modern practices’ (which, in earlier chapters, I have
associated with ‘slowing them down’), will be rejected
by those who hold that these practices are synonymous
with civilisation, bearers of a future in which the whole
of humanity will be liberated from the transcendences
that divide it and set it at odds with itself (STENGERS, 2018, p. 133)
    
<h3>STENGERS, GAIA, CIVILIZAÇÃO</h3>

To name Gaia is to
name a future that could well ‘reconcile’ our contradictions in reference to a long superseded past, to the times
when it was still possible to have debates about ‘civilisation’. Barbarism, which is coming, would rule supreme (STENGERS, 2018, p. 134)
    
<h3>STENGERS, TERRA, INTRUSÃO</h3>

The time is over when this ‘we’ could think it
was free to discuss whether the Earth should be defined
as the totality of the resources available for our use, or
should be protected. ‘We’ face a devastating power suddenly intruding into the stories we tell about ourselves
but cannot realise, or make real, what is happening (STENGERS, 2018, p. 134)
    
<h3>STENGERS, INTRUSÃO DE GAIA, CRISE, FUTURO</h3>

But the intrusion of Gaia is not a crisis, in the sense
of a transitional period that would allow us to envisage
the post-crisis. She will be a permanent part of our future,
raising the question: will this future be worth living? As
for the fear of misunderstanding, it is certainly elicited by
the fact that I gave a name – Gaia, as if it were a person
– to what scientists are figuring out to be a complex
assemblage of natural processes. Is it a simple metaphor,
or am I one of those who ‘believe’ that the Earth is a being
endowed with intentions, if not a consciousness? (STENGERS, 2018, p. 135)
    
<h3>STENGERS, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA, TERRA, DESENVOLVIMENTO</h3>

. Climate change,
and all the other processes that are poisoning life on this
Earth, and which have their common origin in what is
called development, certainly concern all those who live
here, from fish to people. But naming Gaia is an operation addressed to ‘us’, that tries to arouse an ‘us’ who
would no longer take itself for the anonymous ‘one’ (STENGERS, 2018, p. 135)
    
<h3>STENGERS, LOVELOCK, GAIA, ORGANISMO</h3>

Certainly, and unfortunately for
us, Lovelock may have been wrong when he proposed
that Gaia was, like a healthy organism, gifted with selfstabilising properties. We know only too well, now, that
the global result of the complex, non-linear couplings
between processes which compose her, and which used
to sustain what we have so long taken for granted, was
never stable, only metastable, subject to brutal, global
mutation. But Lovelock was right to propose that we
learn to address this assemblage of processes as an
individual being, because the way it answers to perturbations entails a complex and individualised processual
coherence, irreducible to a simple sum of modifications (STENGERS, 2018, p. 136)
    
<h3>STENGERS, GAIA, TERRA, HISTÓRIA</h3>

Thus, naming this being Gaia is not giving another
name to the Earth. Neither is Gaia to be confused with
the nourishing land so many peoples care for; nor with
the Mother whose primordial rights some demand we
recognise and respect. She doesn’t contradict these other
figures, nor is she their rival. She is adding a further figuration which is specifically relevant for us who belong
to a history that has relegated these other figures to the
register of ‘purely cultural’ beliefs (STENGERS, 2018, p. 136)
    
<h3>STENGERS, GAIA, NOMEAR</h3>

I had to begin with Gaia in order to situate my
approach, which I would characterise as inseparably
constructivist, pragmatist and speculative. The point is
not to add a touch of mystery to the intricate intercoupling of purely material processes that scientists
try to decipher. Gaia, as an implacable, unintentional
power, blindly answering to the reckless character of
what we call progress, is without mystery. Naming her
is rather giving a name to the novelty of the event, the
irruption of a new kind of transcendence which must be
acknowledged by those who equated human emancipation with the denial of any transcendence (STENGERS, 2018, p. 137)
    
<h3>STENGERS, GOVERNO, CAPITALISMO VERDE</h3>

 Changing course
at a planetary level is in itself a daunting perspective, but
it is specifically so today, when what prevails at every
level is the imperative of competition, that is, the economic war of one against all. This is why some of those
in government who don’t believe in ‘green capitalism’
may conclude that it is better to wait for the time when
action will be forced upon us, trusting that we will then
find a solution (STENGERS, 2018, p. 138)
    
<h3>STENGERS, ESTUDANTES, MATTERS OF CONCERN</h3>

 Instead of putting ourselves in the position of our children or our
children’s children, we might envisage today’s answer to
our students if they were to ask us: ‘What are you doing
with what you know? How is it changing your matters
of concern?’
If such a question were asked, the answer might have
to be that our thinking, imagining, envisaging and proposing are mobilised elsewhere (STENGERS, 2018, p. 140)
    
<h3>STENGERS, ACADEMIA, BENCHMARK</h3>

As
we know, even academic fields that produce no patents
have now been submitted to the general imperative of
benchmark evaluation, having to accept the judgement
of an academic market ruled by competition (STENGERS, 2018, p. 140)
    
<h3>STENGERS, PRÁTICAS MODERNAS</h3>

Turning now to those practices I would call modern
– since one way or another they have defined themselves
in terms of the conquest of knowledge and the mission
to civilise others – I know that some critical academics
might feel unconcerned at the idea of reclaiming and
protest, since they no longer endorse this conquering
and missionary enterprise (STENGERS, 2018, p. 141)
    
<h3>STENGERS, RECLAIM, DEFINIÇÃO</h3>

They also have to reclaim a different, positive, definition of themselves and of civilisation, in order to regain
relevance and become capable of weaving relations with
different peoples and natures (STENGERS, 2018, p. 141)
    
<h3>STENGERS, IDEIAS FILOSÓFICAS, CONQUISTA CIVILIZATÓRIA, MOBILIZAÇÃO, OBJETIVIDADE, RACIONALIDADE</h3>

Philosophical ideas were certainly active in the modern
enterprise of civilising conquest. They were mobilised in
particular in order to turn modern science into a general
and emancipatory model of objectivity, rationality and
universality, which, as such, authorised understanding
the ways of being and knowing of other peoples as a
question of cultural diversity only. It may be because I
learned to become a philosopher in close contact with
physicists that I felt that this model was a lie. Indeed,
these physicists were engaged in an adventure, passionately trying to construct their own questions, to
answer problems that were problems of their field’s own
making, and not at all participating in some consensual
advancement of knowledge (STENGERS, 2018, p. 142)
    
<h3>STENGERS, GALILEU, </h3>

Thus, on the one
hand Galileo was the initiator of a collective adventure
that unites ‘colleagues’ in thinking passionately in terms
of possible experimental achievements, colleagues who
share the need to verify that a claimed reliable witness
is able to resist their objections and to force their agreement, because their own future work will depend on
such a witness and the new possibilities it opens up. On
the other hand, he was the first to promote the general,
unilateral authority of science, conquering the world,
defining what really matters and what are mere illusory
beliefs, thus giving his blessing to the destruction of
innumerable other ways of relating, knowing, feeling
and interpreting (STENGERS, 2018, p. 143)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIÊNCIA, CRIAÇÃO, DIFERENÇA</h3>

We can only dream of another story, in which the
unifying thread of what we call Science would have been
the demanding, specific character of scientific achievement – the commitment to create situations that confer
on what scientists address the power to make a crucial
difference in regard to the value of their questions (STENGERS, 2018, p. 144)
    
<h3>STENGERS, DESCONSTRUÇÃO, RAZÃO, OBJETIVIDADE</h3>

 I do not wish
to deconstruct what has been called Reason, Objectivity
or the Advance of Knowledge in order to uncover, for
instance, the conquering machine they conceal. Indeed,
such a deconstruction, however legitimate, might justify the conclusion that the knowledge economy is only
destroying scientists’ illusions, which would make it
impossible to acknowledge their outrage, despair and
mounting cynicism, or to address them as potential participants in any reclaiming operation. Thus, even if it
is factually justified, deconstruction fails from a pragmatic, speculative point of view: from the point of view
of its effects, it leaves us with a more desolate, empty
world (STENGERS, 2018, p. 145)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIENTISTAS CIVILIZADOS, CONFIABILIDADE</h3>

Civilised scientists would be the first to affirm that
both the reliability of their results and the competence
of their objecting colleagues are relative to experimentally purified, well-controlled laboratory experiments,
which require ignoring what may be important factors
outside the laboratory. They would thus acknowledge
that whatever they achieve may well lose this specific
reliability when it leaves the network of research laboratories (STENGERS, 2018, p. 147)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIÊNCIA CIVILIZADA, ECONOMIA DO CONHECIMENTO</h3>

Again, this story about civilised science has a dreamlike quality, just like the one in which relevance would
have been the unifying thread of what we call Science.
And, again, the dream is to dissolve the amalgamated
mixture that our own history has produced, where
only certain questions will be taken into account, while
others, identified with a subjective, irrational resistance
to progress, will be ignored. We now have to acknowledge the result: up until the advent of the knowledge
economy, scientists may well have protected the reliability of scientific claims, but they were active participants
in a mode of development that we are now forced to
recognise as having been radically unsustainable, and as
becoming more so today (STENGERS, 2018, p. 148)
    
<h3>STENGERS, ECOLOGIA POLÍTICA, ECONOMIA POLÍTICA, LÓGICA CAPITALISTA</h3>

A choice has to be
made between political ecology and political economy,
and more precisely what I called above capitalist logic. I
would characterise this logic as intrinsically incapable of
being civilised, because what matters for it is not possibilities for relations, but opportunities for exploitation (STENGERS, 2018, p. 149)
    
<h3>STENGERS, CIENTISTAS, MODERNOS, SLOW FOOD</h3>

For scientists educated in modern
research institutions, whatever requires slowing down
mobilisation amounts to a distraction, a diversion from
the scientists’ one true mission of advancing knowledge.
We thus need the same kind of deep change that slow
food movements propose (STENGERS, 2018, p. 150)
    
<h3>STENGERS, INTRUSÃO DE GAIA, REINVENÇÃO POLÍTICA</h3>

The intrusion of Gaia is a danger for all natures and
all peoples on the Earth, but it may also legitimise the
brutal demand that all peoples acknowledge that they
are in the same boat, that they all have to agree to
present what they know to each other, but in a way
that renders these knowledges ‘politically active’, liable
to political reinvention (STENGERS, 2018, p. 151)
    
<h3>STENGERS, COSMOPOLÍTICA, CENA POLÍTICA, PROCESSO POLÍTICO</h3>

Cosmopolitics demands that the political scene be
conceived in such a way that collective thinking proceed ‘in the presence of’ those who belong to these
worlds, and who risk otherwise being unheard because
they refuse to accept that the meaning of what they are
attached to will be determined by the political process (STENGERS, 2018, p. 152)
    

<h3>STENGERS, COSMOS, SLOWING DOWN</h3>

The cosmos, as alluded to in cosmopolitics, thus
intervenes as a way of ‘slowing down’, of resisting the
idea that it must matter for everybody that a correct
position be reached, which should be accepted by all
those concerned (STENGERS, 2018, p. 152)
    

<h3>STENGERS, COSMOS, COSMOPOLÍTICA, MODO DE EXISTÊNCIA</h3>

The cosmos of cosmopolitics must therefore be distinguished from any particular cosmos or world as a
particular tradition may conceive of it, or from something that would transcend all of them. There is no
representative of the cosmos as such, no one talks in its
name, and it is not a matter of special concern. Its mode
of existence is rather reflected in an artificial staging to
be invented, the efficacy of which would be to expose,
to the fullest extent, the consequences of decisions that
are made (STENGERS, 2018, p. 152-153)
    

<h3>STENGERS, COSMOPOLÍTICA</h3>

 Cosmopolitics has nothing to do with the
miracle of decisions that ‘make everyone agree’. It rather
concerns the demand that decisions be taken in the full
and vivid awareness of their consequences. No decision is ever innocent. What is important here is the
prohibition against ignoring, forgetting, or, worse still,
humiliating. Those who gather around an issue have to
know that nothing can erase the debt binding their decision to its eventual victims (STENGERS, 2018, p. 154)
    

<h3>STENGERS, FICÇÃO CIENTÍFICA, INTRUSÃO DE GAIA</h3>

It may be objected that this is mere science fiction, or
speculative fabulation, incapable of helping us in what
is our most urgent task of facing up to the challenge
associated with the intrusion of Gaia. As I have already
remarked, my real concern is about what is already
happening now, and will intensify when the urgency is
finally acknowledged. I do not know, nobody knows
today, if and how we will be able to compose with
Gaia, to answer what is not her challenge but the challenge of the intrusion we have unleashed. I am part of
a generation that will have disappeared by the time this
question is properly engaged with (STENGERS, 2018, p. 155)
    

<h3>STENGERS, TRADIÇÃO, CRENÇAS, LÓGICA CAPITALISTA</h3>

The idea that we belong to a tradition that
is doomed to define other peoples as entertaining mere
beliefs, or nature as a mere resource, is a very infectious one, which you meet everywhere. It breeds guilt and poisons our capacity to resist, leading us instead to
identify with the capitalist logic that has captured us (STENGERS, 2018, p. 155-156)
    

<h3>STENGERS, GAIA, DIFERENÇA</h3>

We do not know if, or how, we will be able to compose with Gaia, but we have no other option than to
trust that we can make a difference, however small, a
difference that calls for other differences to be made
elsewhere. What I have related is just a tale, which, as
such, certainly cannot hope to make ‘the’ difference (STENGERS, 2018, p. 156)
