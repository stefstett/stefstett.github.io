<h3>BUELL, FIM DO MUNDO, BOMBA ATÔMICA, BÍBLIA</h3>

Perry Miller, in an essay entitled ‘End of the World’, wrote that
with the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima on 6 August
1945, the ‘narrative [of The Book of Revelation] for the first
time becomes historical’ (Miller, 1956: 238). Miller envisioned
nuclear destruction in biblical terms, as a horrific singularity, a
complete end to a completely unique creation; he differentiated
it, however, as one brought about by human action, not divine
intervention. Invoking still further features of biblical tradition,
Winston Churchill fused them together with nuclear devastation
to make a powerfully novel image. He called the atomic bomb
‘the Second Coming in Wrath’, adding that ‘the atomic bomb is
the good news of damnation’ (Noble, 1999: 108). (BUELL, 2010, p. 13)

<h3>BUELL, APOCALIPSE, HUMANO</h3>

But it was reinvention that made the most difference in the
following years. By the 1960s, Miller’s subtler perception – that
the narrative of the apocalypse had suddenly become one of
human, not divine history – had acquired a different referent (BUELL, 2010, p. 13)

<h3>BUELL, ANTROPOCENO</h3>

People were altering and destroying all of nature,
despite its vastness; they now needed to realize that they were
poised on the very brink of finishing the job. This perception
quickly became fundamental to the phenomenal success of the
post-war environmental movement. Indeed, two contrary, but
mutually reinforcing strains of feeling animated that movement:
a sudden and passionate upsurge in the idealization of wilderness, of unspoiled nature – one that associated nature with
beauty, purity, pristinity, equilibrium and health – was paired
with an equally irruptive awareness of the fact that an ecological
doomsday was imminently at hand. (BUELL, 2010, p. 14)

<h3>BUELL, APOCALIPSE AMBIENTAL</h3>

One thing that all of this literature and some of the nonfiction make clear is that the environmental apocalyptic mode
continued and complicated what nuclear apocalypse began (BUELL, 2010, p. 15)

<h3>BUELL, APOCALIPSE AMBIENTAL</h3>

Environmental apocalypse was thus closer than nuclear to the
biblical tradition of salvific truth (BUELL, 2010, p. 16)

<h3>BUELL, AMBIENTALISTAS, REVELAÇÃO</h3>

Environmental prophets’ truth was far more
difficult. It was a revelation of an apocalypse human beings
created for themselves; that revelation, moreover, might very
well not be a saving one. To ‘save’ it had to instigate change not
just by the enlightened few, but by the collective, and if that
happened the revelation would cease to be. True, if it didn’t
yield such change, it would indeed come true – releasing forces
that would come, if not in wrath, then in withering or tragic
irony to deny salvation to all. (BUELL, 2010, p. 16)

<h3>BUELL, CRISE AMBIENTAL</h3>

Worse, they advocated policies
against them that were positively cruel. On the other hand,
the other regular enemies of environmental crisis screeds were
Carson’s chemical industry, the Meadows’ corporate capitalism,
and Wylie’s demagogic politicians; stigmatizing these, however,
hardly seems cruel. More important still than this lack of clear
judgment was that all judgment was called into question by
the dominant rhetoric of environmental apocalypticism. (BUELL, 2010, p. 16)

<h3>BUELL, APOCALIPSE AMBIENTAL</h3>

The first generation of environmental apocalyptics thus proceeded to construct an extremely complex discourse: one which
fused nature traditions with apocalypticism, reworking both,
even as it united scientific analysis with political urgency. That
urgency, moreover, expressed itself through powerfully and artfully crafted prophetic-apocalyptic rhetoric (BUELL, 2010, p. 17)

<h3>BUELL, LÓGICA, REVELAÇÃO, </h3>

For writers in the 1960s and 1970s, these rhetorics were all
equally logics and revelations. Deployed against the era’s fundamental attitudes, they overturned them: they revealed. Depicting
humans as having trapped themselves in a terrible rush towards
world-end, they expressed a terrible logic. Together, they distinctively and creatively gave force to the feeling that the environmental problems of the day amounted to apocalypse – to rupture,
world-end and a last judgment on humanity (BUELL, 2010, p. 18)

<h3>BUELL, ECOSSISTEMA</h3>

 It climaxes in a final, terrible revelation: the oceans, earth’s last ecosystem, are finally dead, and
people are now eating not plankton, as they are told they are,
but each other. But along with this maximally gloomy, ironic
revelation, the film presents a second, more genuinely powerful
one. In the famous scene in the euthanasia centre, the film
reaches beyond itself to create enormous pathos (BUELL, 2010, p. 19)

<h3>BUELL, APOCALIPSE AMBIENTAL</h3>

In just a few short years, however, proponents of environmental
apocalypse were made to seem just that – a bunch of monotonal, gloomy, anti-human, neo-Malthusian purveyors of doom,
nothing but doom (BUELL, 2010, p. 20)

<h3>BUELL, ANTROPOCENO, APOCALIPSE AMBIENTAL</h3>

In essence, the dialectic went as follows.
Humanity’s heroic era of mastery of nature (thesis) was opposed
by the belated, but powerful appearance of environmental apocalypse (antithesis); the new, boundless possibilities of society,
just now being revealed as incorporating both the ideology of
mastery and the logic of environmental crisis were the triumphant synthesis (BUELL, 2010, p. 23)

<h3>BUELL, APOCALIPSE AMBIENTAL</h3>

It is impossible to overemphasize the importance of these
political and structural factors in turning the force of apocalyptic rhetoric unhappily back on environmentalists. But it is also
profoundly wrong to portray environmental apocalypticism,
let alone environmental thought and activism, as ‘over’. Just the
opposite is the case. For, as it lost ground, the predominantly
nature-based environmental movement of the 1970s (including
large mainstream environmental organizations like the Sierra
Club and the World Wildlife Fund [the ‘majors’], philosophical
movements like Deep Ecology, and smaller radical groups like
Earth First!) began going through considerable change. One
important strand of this process involved a transformation of
the discourse of environmental apocalypse (BUELL, 2010, p. 25)

<h3>BUELL, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA, ALARMISMO</h3>

Old environmental problems became worse, not better.
Measurements of ecological damage showed deterioration on
far vaster scales. If the economy had globalized dramatically,
so had damage to oceans, fisheries, soils, tropical forests, mangrove swamps, wetlands and coral reefs; depletion of freshwater
and erosion of the atmosphere had dramatically worsened. The
ozone hole(s) had indeed surprised scientists and society with a
further demonstration of humanity’s ability to erode the entire
biosphere in a short period of time; despite the Reagan administration’s attempts to neutralize this concern by sneering, an
urgent global initiative was created to arrest the damage.
Climate change science presented steadily more certain and
alarming pictures of major crisis ahead; concern was kicked
up to a significant new level with the formation of the IPCC in
1990. Population growth had indeed been accommodated by
the Green Revolution and rates of population increase were
even declining, but Green Revolution agricultural techniques
and fossil-fuel dependencies were becoming increasingly seen
not as solutions, but as having created near-future human and
ecological risks. Species extinctions appeared now truly major (BUELL, 2010, p. 26)

<h3>BUELL, AIDS, PANDEMIA</h3>

Though few have called HIV-AIDS an environmental disease, it
indeed emerged and spread, thanks to traditional environmental
problems like habitat destruction and ecologically harmful
development, as well as from developments traditionally seen as
social, such as increased poverty, inequality, and the new global mobility of people. But even apart from AIDS, new disease
prospects today are severe. Today, worries include zoonotic
flu pandemics resulting from a complex of environmental and
social changes and the spread of non-exotic tropical diseases
thanks to globalization and global warming. These specifics
indicate a more fundamental change. Human health concerns
are fusing today with environmental ones (BUELL, 2010, p. 26-27)

<h3>BUELL, APOCALIPSE</h3>

As this happens, I see apocalypse being reinvented again in two ways. One is in more intimately realistic portrayals of damage done and in discourses
of human-environmental mourning. The second is in depicting
humans’ one-way trip through time as not a rush to doom, but
a conscious immersion in uncertainty and rising risk. Risk
awareness is definitely on the rise today; indeed, the discipline
of risk-management is an attempt to contain it. But, as Ulrich
Beck, risk’s preeminent theoretician, makes clear, risk today
is actually not finally manageable or limitable. Increased consciousness of it, today, haunts us far more than any sense of
ends to come (Beck, 1996: 28). (BUELL, 2010, p. 30)

<h3>BUELL, APOCALIPSE, MODO DE VIDA, CATÁSTROFE</h3>

To say that apocalypse has become today a way of life is, of
course, to suggest an attitude that undergirds much environmental passivity and quiet desperation today. The metaphor is,
in short, a central expression of our current environmental
dilemmas. It also is something that, strange as it may seem,
can and already is being used to help escort us further and
further into catastrophe. (BUELL, 2010, p. 30)

<h3>BUELL, FICÇÃO CIENTÍFICA</h3>

 Instead it is something audiences are meant to and indeed do consume: sci-fi’s
obsession with wrecked, militarized, post-natural environments
of social meltdown and perpetual high-tech combat (and its
invention of special effects to present these scenes and wow
audiences) is directed at transforming apocalypse into exciting
entertainment for the multitudes (BUELL, 2010, p. 31)

<h3>BUELL, METÁFORA, APOCALIPSE</h3>

But the metaphor of apocalypse as way of life can also authorize action more informed, open-eyed and responsive to recent
change than before. The creeping spread of crisis into more
physical, social and psychological places, and the intimacy with
which we feel it, opens up new sites for action and coalitions
for change. Risk represents a much more sustainable sense of
urgency, and uncertainty fosters experiment, small and large. (BUELL, 2010, p. 31)

<h3>BUELL, AQUECIMENTO GLOBAL, CRISE AMBIENTAL</h3>

Global warming right now is our model environmental crisis.
It embodies and features all the changes noted above. It is a
crisis inseparably entwining people and nature. It is not revealed
to us by prophets; it is more potently a part of us; it has worked
its way deeper and deeper into our daily consciousness (BUELL, 2010, p. 32)
