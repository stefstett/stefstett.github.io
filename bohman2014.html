             <h3>BOHMAN, ROMERO, MÍDIA</h3>
            
            The arc of Romero's work, and 2008's <i>Diary of the Dead</i> in particular, reveals media ad inherently zombifying - that media makes everything the same, destroys distinctions, and obliterates our sense of history and the real. Romero's work suggests that our growing mediation makes our relation to our cultural past become something like that of the zombie's: we return to our old shuffling gounds and reenact old practices, but without a sense of it meaning much, without knowing why, without it being real (BOHMAN, 2014, p. 152)
            
             <h3>BOHMAN, BAUDRILLARD, EVENTO, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            For Baudrillard, an event, like the figure of the zombie itself, is characterized "by its uncaniness". An event has both a "troubling strangeness - it is the irruption of something improbable and impossible - and... [a] troubling familirity: from the outset it seems totally self-explanatory, as though predestined, as though it could not but take place (BOHMAN, 2014, p. 153-154)
            
             <h3>BOHMAN, NOTLD, ROMERO</h3>
            
            According to McLuhan, the historical moment of <i>Understanding Media</i>, and of <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> as well, is a unique one in which the advent of electric media is in the middle of producing a profound shift in Western man, a shift for which the zombies of Romero's film ultimately provide a powerful and troublesome articulation (BOHMAN, 2014, p. 158)
            
             <h3>BOHMAN, ZUMBI, NOTLD, MASSA</h3>
            
            When the zombies first begin to gather in <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>, they do so as a mass (BOHMAN, 2014, p. 159)
            
             <h3>BOHMAN, MASSA, ZUMBI, REPRESENTAÇÃO, MÍDIA</h3>
            
            The logic of the modern mass public, which undergirds this representation of the zombie, stands behind the film's representations of broadcast news media as well (BOHMAN, 2014, p. 160)
            
             <h3>BOHMAN, ROMERO, MÍDIA, HALL</h3>
            
            Romero's shift in this film corresponds to a shift in media theory as well. This conceptual shift, led by Stuart Hall among others, resulted in a move from theory in which "the process of communication [is conceptualized] in terms of a circulation or loop", and which "has been criticized for its linearity - sender/message/receiver", to a theory that conceptualizes "this process in terms of a structure produced and sustained through the articulation of linked but distinctive moments - production, circulation, distribution/consumption, reproduction (BOHMAN, 2014, p. 165)
            
             <h3>BOHMAN, NOTLD, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> presents a few standout zombies through narrative attention or some singular features, but these figures are <i>not</i> coded like those in <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> (BOHMAN, 2014, p. 166)
            
             <h3>BOHMAN, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> seems to foreground the operation of codes, presenting the zombie as an unwitting carrier of codes, the zombie body as inscripted vessel (BOHMAN, 2014, p. 166)
            
             <h3>BOHMAN, APOCALIPSE, HISTÓRIA, CAPITALISMO</h3>
            
            In <i>Land</i> the apocalypse hasn't produced a meaningful historical break of a radically new society; instead, the same set of racial, class, and capitalist structures have re-formed, but they are starker ad more explicit (BOHMAN, 2014, p. 174)
            
             <h3>BOHMAN, ZUMBI, MEMÓRIA RESIDUAL</h3>
            
            Even the zombies of <i>Land of the Dead</i> seem trapped in these old social forms. In the film's brilliant opening sequence, the camera descends on a bucolic small town where zombies slowly shuffle about performing bucolic small-town activities: high-school-sweetheart zombies take a stroll around the town square, where a zombie band plays in the square's gazebo. Big Daddy, an African American zombie who owns a gas station and autoshop, is poised to help a customer when the bell rings. In a form more exaggerated and explicit than the dead consumers returning to the mall in <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>, <i>Land</i> shows us zombies endlessly reenacting old practices and relations (BOHMAN, 2014, p. 174-175)
            
             <h3>BOHMAN, BAUDRILLARD, EVENTO, ZUMBI, ROMERO, HISTÓRIA, MÍDIA</h3>
            
            With <i>Land</i> we see what Baudrillard will soon help us articulate: that the zombie event as it is increasingly imagined by Romero is a peculiarly contemporary kind of event. It isn't an event that introduces radical historical change - in fact, such change seems no longer capable of being imagined - but instead is a kind of absolute disorder. The proliferation of records, of information and its reproduction, creates a troubling sense of irreality while making the real seem accessible only through this media (BOHMAN, 2014, p. 175)
            
             <h3>BOHMAN, EVENTO</h3>
            
            Deb bemoans the fact that the proliferation of unofficial voices and guerilla attempts to document these events don't lead to some greater sense of their "truth", something that their "raw" and unofficial status should ostensibly supply (BOHMAN, 2014, p. 177).
            
             <h3>BOHMAN, ROMERO, INFORMAÇÃO</h3>
            
            In this form and affective nullity, <i>Diary of the Dead</i> embodies a problem that it can't quite articulate, let alone powerfully address. The film seems to circle and even inhabit this problem without ever getting clear about it. Moreover, this difficulty seems to plague Romero's own accounts of the film as well. In an interview with the <i>New York Times</i>, Romero warns, "It's scary out there, man... There's just so much information, and it's absolutely uncontrolled. Half of it isn't even information. It's entertainment or opinion. I wanted to do something that would get at this octopus [...]" (BOHMAN, 2014, p. 178)
            
             <h3>BOHMAN, BAUDRILLARD, ZUMBI, APOCALIPSE</h3>
            
            But the ineffectuality of that supposed truth is what lingers, and it's here where Baudrillard proves most useful. He offers us an account of why the film <i>must</i> fail at this critical moment, along with greater insight into the heightened popularity in recent years of iagining the zombie apocalypse and the complex desire that the zombie event stroke (BOHMAN, 2014, p. 179)
