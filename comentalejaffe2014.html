             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, ZUMBI, ECOLOGIA</h3>
            
            And yet we hardly need to think about zombie fixation in human terms at all. Ozone holes, AIDS, Y2K, computer viruses, mad cow disease, SARS, MRSA, terrorist attacks, unending wars, miscellaneous hazmat, environmental degradation, climate change, self-replicating Ponzi schemes - panic culture grows around us, one unmanageable crisis after another, pushing our fascination with the zombie into the realms of hard science (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 4)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, VÍRUS, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            As seen in recent outbreak of outbreak films and the viral success of viral smartphone apps such as <i>Plague Inc.</i>, zombie fixation flows everywhere through a mass-mediated virophilia. Derived from <i>virus</i>, a Latin word meaning a poisonous sap ("I tried to take a blood sample and instead extracted only brown, viscous matter" [Brooks, <i>World War Z</i>, 7]), and the Greek <i>-phile</i>, meaning, of course, one who loves, virophilia = infection + affection. The word speaks to (1) our fascination with both real and hypothetical contagions, plagues, viruses, and other agents of noxious transmission and (2) our obsessive etiological tracking of ideas, trends, and parasitic social malfunction back to its presumed origin, whether a batch of toxic sap, a polluted patient zero, a bite-marked child, rabid critter, microbe, prion, or spilled barrel of radioactive matter (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 6) 
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, VÍRUS, TECNOLOGIA, REC, FEMINISMO</h3>
            
            But for virophilia-as-technophilia nothing beats <i>[REC]</i> (2007), the Spanish zombie classic that locks a bubbly late-night television reporter inside a quarantined building infected with a virus that is as much biological as it is demonic. <i>[REC]</i> is notable for the way it stages Angela's degradation as spactator and spectacle; as the reporter confronts the stages of female life as a process of bodily corruption (culminating in the horrific sunken-breated inmage of the "Medieros Girl"), so the audience is forced to confront its own desirous relation to gendered violence and decay (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 7)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, TECNOLOGIA, MORTE, INTERNET, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            And nothing seems to die anymore. Everything thought or said exists in a virtual half-life, literally, in the massive digital crypt of the Internet, and experientially, in a world haunted, morally, philosophically, by its own pasts. Zombie philosophy, zombie economics, zombie computers, zombie genes - are these really any different from the zombie bikers, zombie nuns, zombie baseball players thet first stalked the frames of George A. Romero's films, generic doubles of their original, vital selves? (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 8)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, ZUMBI, MORTE, PRAZER</h3>
            
            Indeed, zombie killing has become as banal as deleting four hundred emails on a Monday morning, as Chuck Klosterman claims, but that doesn't negate the fact that they must be killed of that the killing is not without its pleasures (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 8)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, CONTRADIÇÃO, ZUMBI, CULTURA, VIDA, MORTE</h3>
            
            But "today's zombie" is a contradiction in more ways than one. Wherever there's been culture (and <i>culture</i> might really be another word for <i>germ</i>, for the organization of life and death), there have been zombies (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 9)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, ZUMBI, METÁFORA, VIOLÊNCIA, </h3>
            
            But even though zombies come across as (over)ripe for metaphorization, they themselves are not metaphors. If anything, them seem - in their quick violence and slow decay - to eat through the logic of metaphor (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 13-14)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, ZUMBI, MORTE, SIGNIFICADO</h3>
            
            The zombie's status as undead - immortal in its mortality - exists in its being as sign, but only as it wreaks havoc on signification (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 14)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, ZUMBI, APOCALIPSE, NATUREZA</h3>
            
            In turn, the zombie apocalypse becomes the moment of denegation, the negation of negation, when all signs lose their naturalness, when the figural becomes unbearable literal, splattered with blood and brains (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 15)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, ZUMBI, VIETNÃ, VÍRUS</h3>
            
            So we read zombie films not just for metaphors (of, say, consumer culture or Vietnam or AIDS) but for the explosion of sign systems that litter their frames - the blown newspapers, floating bills, illegible graffiti, unheard loudspeakers (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 18).
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, BIOLOGIA, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            And don't tell us any of the usual stuff about <i>Leuchochloridium paradoxum</i> (zombie snails) or <i>Ampulex compressa</i> (zombie roaches) or <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> (zombie rats) (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 20)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, ZUMBI, MONSTRO, MORTE, TABU</h3>
            
            Because zombies are already dead, they don't inspire the same ethical handwriting as other monsters, and they can be killed with impunity. Zombies are like cartoon characters: they always bounce back, and then they don't. In their dump plasticity, they allow us to travesty death and othe tabooed topics (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 20)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, ZUMBI, ESCRAVIDÃO, ROMERO, MINORIA</h3>
            
            While early zombies carried associations with slavery and the slave trade (associations that Romero sometimes references in his films), more contemporary versions come across as misunderstood minorities (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 21)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, ZUMBI, CIÊNCIA </h3>
            
            Arguably, every zombie is in search of a father - the deadbeat zombie master (aka, the <i>bokor</i>), scientist, government official who abandoned him at birth in the dumpster behind the lab. Or better, in <i>Pontypool</i> (2009), every zombie is in search of a lost mother, not so much looking to consume human flesh, but to gnaw and burrow its way back into the womb (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 29)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, ZUMBI, HUMANIDADE, COLETIVIDADE</h3>
            
            In all this, though, <i>Frankenstein</i> isn't really a representativa zombie text. Most of the time what's scary about zombies is their blank inhumanity and the fact that there's usually more than one (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 30)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, ZUMBI, FELIX-MENTOR, CLAIRVIUS, HAITI</h3>
            
            When it comes to real-life zombies, three sorts of claimants come to ming: (1) historical-ethnographic representatives such as Felicia Felix-Mentor and Clairvius Narcisse, studies to instantiate the Haitian/West African folkloric roots of the zombie concept; (2) heinous killers such as Jeffrey Dahmer or the Bath-Salts Zombie, humans who did terrible, untraviolent thing to other humans, attackers for whom the word <i>zombie</i> has become a kind of shorthand for journalists unraveling their stratagems; and (3) Zombie Boy, a (real, living, non-zombie) person who is a passionate fan of zombies (an <i>F-zombie</i>, who has altered his physical appearance to seem more zombielike (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 32)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, FOLCLORE, HISTÓRIA, ZUMBI, COLONIZAÇÃO</h3>
            
            Folklore, in her account, no matter how outlandish, serves as a negotiation of material history, with the zombie stalking the colonial horizon as the dehumanized refuse of imperial capital (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 33)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, VENENO</h3>
            
            However, three classes of ingredients were common to all preparations: (1) charred and ground bones and other human remains, (2) plants with urticating hairs, spines, toxic resigns, or calcium oxalate crystals, and (3) puffer fish (ver Hahn, "Dead Men Walking") (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 37)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, HURSTON, DAVIS, FOLCLORE, MORTE</h3>
            
            Like Hurston, Davis Associates the H-zombie with a folkloric legacy of slavery that naturally asserts that some forms of labor are worse than death (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 37)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            "Did we just watch a 'zombie' movie?" we're asking, after watching <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i> (1956) or <i>The Birds</i> (1963) or <i>Assault on Precinct 13</i> (1976) or <i>Zulu</i> (1964) or even Ionesco's play <i>Rhinoceros</i> (1959) (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 46)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, DEFINIÇÃO, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            Something may be zombie, if it (1) is named <i>zombie</i> (or, some equivalent word; i.e., <i>thing</i>, <i>walker</i>, <i>roamer</i>, <i>geek</i>, <i>biter</i>, <i>creeper</i>, <i>deadlite</i>, <i>infected</i>, <i>skel</i>, <i>draugr</i>, <i>crazie</i>, <i>zed</i>, <i>zeke</i>, <i>zack</i>, <i>asshole</i>, <i>a-hole</i>, <i>z-hole</i>, etc.; (2) looks like an animated corpse; has a abject/repulsive body; seems actually composed of a corpse or someone who is now dead; (3) preys on the living ("cannibalism"); attacks by biting, scratching, and grasping ("infection"); (4) is relentless, hostile to the living; (5) exhibits mindlessness, weak-mindedness, automatism; (6) assembles by hording, swarming, massing; and (7) can be killed with moral impunity; will kill and "die" by ultraviolent means (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 45-46)
            
             <h3>COMENTALE & JAFFE, UNDEAD, DEFINIÇÃO</h3>
            
            The prefix <i>un-</i> indicates negation, as everyone knows. And <i>dead</i> also designates a negative fact - the negation of life. <i>Undead</i>, strictly speaking, means lack of death, lack of non-life, but the double negative doesn't convey a simple reversal, for the un-dead are no longer (not) alive. The word carries weird pleonasm powers; it packs in the superfluous meanings. <i>Undead</i> as if <i>dead</i> were not enough, works something like <i>overkill</i> through <i>underkill</i>, as in the expression "I couldn't care less", for instance (COMENTALE & JAFFE, 2014, p. 49)
