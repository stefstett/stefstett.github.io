<h3>MOORE, IMAGINAÇÃO POLÍTICA</h3>

How we conceptualize this state shift, and how we imagine what comes next, is crucial.
So too is how we imagine what has occurred. The political imagination and the world historical
imagination form an uncomfortable unity.(MOORE, 2023, p. 97)

 <h3>MOORE, CRISE CLIMÁTICA, ANTROPOGÊNICA, ANTROPOCENO POPULAR</h3>

The climate crisis is anthropogenic. Literally, “made by humans.” We are told this every
time we read, watch, or hear climate news. We hear it almost every time we hear a scholar
speak on climate change, orwhen we read a book or article on the climate crisis. The
“anthropogenic” party line finds few dissidents, regardless of academic discipline or political
sympathy. This is the ideological project of the Popular Anthropocene – distinct from, and yet enabled by, key players in the geological and earth- system sciences.4
Saying the climate crisis is “human- caused” is not just a language problem, but a mode
of reasoning implicated in the climate crisis itself. Both are rooted in a dark history (MOORE, 2023, p. 97-98)

 <h3>MOORE, PROJETO CIVILIZATÓRIO, ETNOCENTRISMO, CAPITALISMO</h3>

This legacy is the long and violent history of Civilizing Projects. If a certain kind
of ethnocentrism has accompanied every great – and not‑so‑great – civilization, capitalism
raised this to an epochal art form (MOORE, 2023, p. 98)

 <h3>MOORE, EUROPA, CIVILIZAÇÃO OCIDENTAL, FORÇA CAPITALISMO, NATUREZA</h3>

Indeed, neither “Europe” nor “Western Civilization” as a geohistorical force or geocultural formation existed before the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, respectively.5
They were inventions of capitalist forces – comprising not only the “material” means
of production but also the “means of mental production.” The obverse of Civilization
was Nature. The uppercase indicates their status as “ruling ideas” – or what I will call
ruling abstractions. These are fetishes in the classic Marxist sense. (MOORE, 2023, p. 98)

 <h3>MOORE, CAPITALISMO, PROJETO CIVILIZATÓRIO, VIOLÊNCIA, NATUREZA</h3>

From the
origins of capitalism, these ruling abstractions redefined the lives and labors of the vast
majority of humans as non‑ work, on the specific basis of their alleged “savagery.” This
is the violence of the Civilizing Project and its antonym, Nature (MOORE, 2023, p. 98)

 <h3>MOORE, IDEOLOGIA, CRISE CLIMÁTICA, PROJETO CIVILIZATÓRIO, CAPITALISMO, IMPERIALISMO, HUMAN </h3>

They require ideologies, and these have contributed mightily to the climate crisis. Civilizing Projects, like all ideologies, do not have “lives of their own,” as reified
incantations of “the West” or “settler colonialism” suggest.7 They are specific class projects
tightly bound to capitalism’s incentive structure. From the beginning, the emergent imperial bourgeoisies “overrepresented” themselves as Human, and expelled everyone else.8
Their enduring ideological claims of Christianizing, Civilizing, or Developmentalist virtue rested on the essential premise that most humans are not really or not fully Human, but
“savage.” Remaking a biological claim about the human species into a historical argument
of causation – through which the “human enterprise” becomes a collective actor – is not
innocent.9 It’s an ideological sleight‑ of‑ hand with deep roots in bourgeois naturalism:
aprocedure that biologizes, and seeks to justify, inequality between humans (MOORE, 2023, p. 98-99)

 <h3>MOORE, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA, ANTROPOGÊNICA, CAPITALOGÊNICA</h3>

To say climate change is not anthropogenic but capitalogenic (“made
by capital”) is a sin against Good Science. The uppercase is again deliberate, because Good
Science is not about truth but power and profit (MOORE, 2023, p. 99)

 <h3>MOORE, HISTÓRIA, NARRATIVA, CLASSE </h3>

History became
a footnote, or worse: it was decomposed into highly stylized and misleading narratives.
In the English vernacular, these are potted histories: superficial storybook narratives
that one likely encountered in high school. These narratives seek to manufacture consent: to inculcate an acceptance of the political order as free, democratic, or otherwise
virtuous. Such potted arguments are instruments of class rule. So it was that this flight
from history was accompanied, and indeed enabled, by the neoliberal academy’s “retreat
from class.”¹³ The flight from world history and the retreat from class were two sides
of the same ideological movement (MOORE, 2023, p. 99)

 <h3>MOORE, NEOLIBERALISMO, CAPITALISMO</h3>

Many leftwing scholars decided that, in the era of neoliberal triumph, capitalism didn’t really exist after all; it was just a figment of the imagination shared by dogmatic Marxists and
neoliberal ideologues alike.15 This fetishization of theory in the academy is so powerful
that I find myself writing, time and again, about how the tasks of revolutionary theory are
historical, or they are nothing. So far, to little effect. Even when capitalism was conceptually
rehabilitated through anti- globalization struggles at the turn of the century, it returned
primarily in a Polanyian incarnation.16 Here was a concept of historical capitalism stripped
of a Marxist theory of exploitation – so much so that today, the radical vernacular insists
upon “decolonization” without so much as a whisper of class exploitation (MOORE, 2023, p. 100)

 <h3>MOORE, HISTÓRIA MUNDIAL, INDUSTRIALIZAÇÃO, COLONIALISMO, INTERPRETAÇÃO</h3>

0 To be clear, world history is not
a restatement of past events and alleged prime movers such as population, industrialization, or colonialism. World history is a mode of interpretation. It foregrounds the
explanation of tipping points, transitions, crises, and significant civilizational expansions
in their historical‑ geographical specificity. Are the origins of the climate crisis found
in England around 1800? Are they located in a wider web of class and imperial relations
across the Atlantic world after 1492? (MOORE, 2023, p. 100)

 <h3>MOORE, ANTROPOCENO POPULAR</h3>

In the 1970s, world‑ historical discussions like this became known as the Transition Debate.²³ For any world‑ historical transition – none more so than the ongoing
demise of Holocene climate stability – such Transition Debates are unavoidable. The
Popular Anthropocene, in this light, wants to eat its cake and have it too. It takes refuge in geological periodization whilst engaging in apromiscuous typological exercise
masquerading as world history. Witness the ‑cene mania of the past decade, mostly
ignoring urgently needed syntheses of history, contemporary politics, and biospheric
change (MOORE, 2023, p. 101)

 <h3>MOORE, ANTROPOCENO POPULAR, HOMEM, NATUREZA, PROJETO CIVILIZATÓRIO </h3>

The Popular Anthropocene has evaded such questions in favor of potted histories
that pit “Man” against “Nature.” That quasi‑ eternal conflict is mediated by population,
technology, and sometimes, great power conflict.28 But these are fragments – not evolving and mutually formative moments of an evolving dialectical whole. Far from intellectual accidents, such fragmentation flows directly from the philosophical reductionism
and Civilizing Projects that initially took shape during the rise of capitalism.29 When
it comes to class analysis and the history of capitalism, the Popular Anthropocene – and the wider Environmentalism of the Rich in which it’s embedded – has established
an intellectual no‑ fly zone (MOORE, 2023, p. 101-102)

 <h3>MOORE, CAPITALOCENO, CRISE CLIMÁTICA, LUTA DE CLASSES</h3>

Neither believes the Capitalocene to be a geological era. On several decisive points, Andreas Malm and I agree: the climate crisis must
be grasped in its historical specificity; the origins of climate crisis are found in geographically specific class struggles; and webs of life are fundamental to any politically
useful conception of class politics and capitalist development (MOORE, 2023, p. 102)

 <h3>MOORE, REVOLUÇÃO INDUSTRIAL, EUROPA OCIDENTAL, PODER MILITAR, ACUMULAÇÃO PRIMITIVA</h3>

For the 1492 thesis, Malm’s fossil capital argument is one crucial element in a longer
story. It’s simply not the whole story. Significantly, the 1830 thesis excludes consideration of the wider historical geographies of class, capital, and empire that predate
“the” Industrial Revolution. The world- ecology alternative begins from the conjuncture
of climate crisis and class revolt in feudalism’s long fourteenth‑ century crisis. The
outcome of those class struggles was a historic defeat for Western Europe’s ruling
classes.³² They tried, and failed, to restore the balance of class power amid the “sociophysical conjuncture” of climate, disease, agro- ecological exhaustion, and class revolt.³³
This internalist “climate fix” strategy having failed, feudal ruling strata stumbled upon
another: move aggressively into the Atlantic world and conquer the Americas, where
the balance of military power ran in their favor.34 Thus began primitive accumulation
in its classic sense: a grand dynamic of world- class formation through which imperial bourgeoisies could mobilize Cheap Nature, including Cheap Labor, on an unprecedented
scale. Within a century of 1492, that movement would subordinate Polish and Irish
labor to the same bloody logic (MOORE, 2023, p. 102-103)

 <h3>MOORE, NATUREZA BARATA, CAPITALISMO, ECOLOGIA MUNDIAL, TRABALHO NÃO-PAGO</h3>

The result was a new accumulation strategy: Cheap Nature. It was premised on devaluing the lives and labors of“women, nature, and colonies.” 38 Here was an ideological,
military, and juridical strategy that enabled “vast but weak” imperialist bourgeoisies
to appropriate unpaid work in a novel and generative way.39 To call these arrangements
feudal is to miss the very foundations of the capitalist world- ecology in unpaid work,
which depended on regimes of Naturalized domination – ordained by so‑ called “natural law.”40 These tendencies rapidly crystallized the world color line and capitalist
patriarchy during the seventeenth century, and were central to the era’s epochal labor
and landscape revolution (MOORE, 2023, p. 103)

 <h3>MOORE, ANTROPOCENO POPULAR, CAPITALOCENO</h3>

The Popular Anthropocene and the 1830 Capitalocene thesis alike have worked
hard to deny early capitalism’s extraordinary environment‑ making revolution. The labor and landscape transformations between 1450 and 1750 cohered the origins
of capitalogenic environmental revolution, creating an eco- historical rupture as great
as any since the dawn of agriculture and the rise of the first cities. Here was the dawn
of a specifically capitalist Pangea (MOORE, 2023, p. 103-104)

 <h3>MOORE, DESMATAMENTO</h3>

In Picardy (northeastern France), it took two
centuries (the twelfth and thirteenth) to clear 12,000 hectares of forest. Four centuries
later, in Bahia (northeastern Brazil) at the height of the sugar boom, 12,000 hectares
offorests were cleared in just one year. That’s a 200‑fold increase. Nor was this an isolated
occurrence. As slave crews were hacking down the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest to secure
new land and cheap fuelwood, there was a similar advance of forest clearance on the distant eastern edge of the Atlantic world. In early- seventeenth- century Poland, workers and
peasants cleared forests at an equally rapid pace, transforming the country’s extraordinary
sylvan resources into timber, arable land for cash crops, potash for bleaching textiles,
and the tar and pitch necessary to make the era’s growing commercial fleets seaworthy (MOORE, 2023, p. 104)

 <h3>MOORE, ALIENAÇÃO</h3>

The new law of value, organizing
regimes of abstract social labor, required a historically novel form of alienation.47 Labor
productivity as the determinant of surplus value came to dominate. This too assumed
diverse forms, but the English yeoman, the Polish serf, the Brazilian planter and slave,
all felt its gravitational pull (MOORE, 2023, p. 105)

 <h3>MOORE, NATUREZA, TERRITÓRIO, TRABALHO NÃO-PAGO</h3>

Nature was therefore not confined to “land” and “land productivity” but
signified the totality of unpaid work necessary to capitalism’s law of value. Most actually productive labor in capitalism was excluded from capitalist “labor productivity”:
above all, the unpaid work of “women, nature, and colonies.” So‑ called “women’s work”
was redefined as non‑ work. Plantation labor – slavery – was redefined as a “school for
civilization.” (MOORE, 2023, p. 105)

 <h3>MOORE, GENOCÍDIO, ECOCÍDIO, REVOLUÇÃO INDUSTRIAL </h3>

By the middle of the eighteenth century, this epochal environment- making revolution was largely exhausted. The profit‑driven genocides and ecocides of the New World
enabled silver mining and sugar planting – two of the era’s greatest engines of capital
accumulation. These engines began to sputter in fits and starts between the 1650s
and the end of the eighteenth century. Slaves, peasants, and workers resisted; soils
were exhausted and eroded; forests were cleared. Early capitalism’s socio‑ ecological
contradictions deepened; resistance to agrarian capitalism, from Russia to Haiti to Peru,
intensified. It was the era of “dual revolutions”: the democratic and the industrial (MOORE, 2023, p. 106)

 <h3>MOORE, CAPITALISMO, PLANTATION</h3>

On the one hand, the
rationalization of the capitalist labor process didn’t begin in England but on the sugar
plantations of the Atlantic world.55 If we want to find the original factories, we need
look no further than the “factories in the field” of early modern sugar plantations (MOORE, 2023, p. 106)

 <h3>MOORE, INDUSTRIALIZAÇÃO, CAPITALISMO, CRISE CLIMÁTICA, NATUREZA BARATA</h3>

This reorients our usual narrative of industrialization, capitalism, and the not- soanthropogenic drivers of today’s climate crisis. It opens fresh questions about the dialectical relations – and class struggles – of peasants, slaves, and sailors against capitalism’s
double register of Cheap Nature: its economic violence and its ruthless geocultural
domination.59 Perhaps most significantly, it connects historically the genesis of the capitalogenic trinity of the climate class divide, climate apartheid, and climate patriarchy
as the driver oftoday’s planetary crisis, not its environmentally determined consequence (MOORE, 2023, p. 107)

 <h3>MOORE, ANTROPOCENO, GEOLÓGICO, POPULAR</h3>

As we have begun
to see, there are two Anthropocenes. One is the Geological Anthropocene. This is the
scholarly conversation about planetary history, centering on so- called “golden spikes”
in the geological record. The other, the Popular Anthropocene, is a conversation over
the historical causes of – and the proposed institutional, market, and technical solutions
to – our deepening climate crisis. The line between the two Anthropocenes is fuzzy and
porous. This is not accidental. Rather, it concerns how scholarly and media gatekeepers license “natural scientists” to speak freely about matters of policy and world history.
The powers- that- be can sleep easily at night knowing that leading climate scientists
will rarely upset the ideological apple cart and identify the capitalist class and capitalogenic climate crisis as the core of the problem (MOORE, 2023, p. 107-108)

 <h3>MOORE, ANTROPOCENO, ANTROPOCENO POPULAR, ANTI-POLÍTICA </h3>

The Anthropocene reduces these relations to technological, technocratic,
and market‑ oriented fixes. Here, the Popular Anthropocene is revealed as an “anti‑ politics
machine.”69 Like most Environmentalism, it converts political questions of inequality
and injustice into technical and scientific problems to be “solved” and “managed.” (MOORE, 2023, p. 109)

 <h3>MOORE, FRONTEIRAS, REVOLUÇÃO INDUSTRIAL, AQUECIMENTO GLOBAL</h3>

The planetary boundaries
image does not invoke change over time, but it is associated with another assumption
that does. This is the claim that the origins of planetary crisis are found in the century
after 1800, commonly narrated as “the” Industrial Revolution. The formula is simple,
comfortable, and therefore tempting: coal plus steam power equals global warming (MOORE, 2023, p. 109)

 <h3>MOORE, COLONIALISMO, GLOBALIZAÇÃO, CLASSE</h3>

 Colonialism is – like globalization two decades ago – cleansed
of its class character. So too with extractivism, climate apartheid, speciesism, and other
environmental bads: they are all generally deployed as academic detergents to wipe
our thinking clean from the muck of class analysis (MOORE, 2023, p. 110)

 <h3>MOORE, AMBIENTALISMO, ANTROPOCENO POPULAR, LUTA DE CLASSES</h3>

The Environmentalism of the Rich and its Popular Anthropocene shapes popular
consciousness in ways that are consonant with techno‑ scientific authoritarianism.84
Eco‑ catastrophism is altogether compatible with Green authoritarianism – a point
argued since Environmentalism’s origins in 1968, and already a reality across the
Global South.85 This Environmentalism imagines the biosphere – and even regional
environments – as somehow outside relations of power, re/production, and inequality.
It excises questions of financialization, of homelessness, of precariousness, of hunger, of poverty, of climate apartheid, climate patriarchy and the climate class divide.
In short, it presents a political imaginary of planetary crisis that designates questions
of democracy as unnecessary (MOORE, 2023, p. 111)

    <h3>MOORE, CRISE CLIMÁTICA, PODER DE CLASSE</h3>

Simply put, the climate crisis
is not merely about distributional consequences; it is about class power in the biosphere (MOORE, 2023, p. 111)

    <h3>MOORE, SEXTA EXTINÇÃO, CAPITALOGÊNICA, MODERNIDADE</h3>

Consider something like the Sixth Extinction.86 This is usually discussed as the
“biodiversity crisis.” What is rarely pointed out in these discussions is that the Sixth
Extinction isn’t anything like the five previous extinctions on Planet Earth. It’s not
the work of an asteroid. It’s not the work of bad technology or inefficient markets
or the “imperial mode of living.”87 It’s the work of capital. It is a capitalogenic process – co‑ produced through modernity’s relations of capital, power, and nature (MOORE, 2023, p. 111)

    <h3>MOORE, SUPERPOPULAÇÃO, PROJETO CIVILIZATÓRIO</h3>

Overpopulation. That must be a bitter pill to swallow for descendants of the fifty
million Native Americans who died in the aftermath of 1492 – a slaving‑ induced movement of genocide that contributed to capitalism’s first great climate crisis in the “long,
cold seventeenth century.”89 To underline the point: it was not a disembodied European
colonialism that propelled these killing fields; it was an emergent capitalist order hungry for Cheap Labor. The ideology of Cheapness was manifest from the start, expressed
in the Prometheanism of the Civilizing Project and its redefinition of indigenous, Celtic,
African, female, Slavic, and other populations as “savage.” (MOORE, 2023, p. 112)

    <h3>MOORE, CRISE PLANETÁRIA, INIMIGO</h3>

Let’s walk through the three big questions of today’s planetary crisis. Who and
what caused this? When and where did this begin? And how did we get here? This might
sound banal, but how we answer these questions decides our politics. The Environmentalism of the Rich, as it coalesced after 1968, delivered a straightforward message:
“We have met the enemy, and he is us. (MOORE, 2023, p. 112)

    <h3>MOORE, HUMANIDADE, CRISE PLANETÁRIA, ANTROPOGÊNICA</h3>

Saying Humanity has caused planetary crisis is a bit like saying Humanity is responsible for the New World genocide after 1492 – or that Humanity is responsible
for the modern slave trade, world wars, or neoliberalism’s Washington Consensus
of finance‑ driven dispossession. Anyone uttering the phrase “anthropogenic genocide”
would be laughed out of the room! Because of course specific relations – of empire,
capital, and class – created these disasters. Calling the planetary crisis anthropogenic
is a non- explanation (MOORE, 2023, p. 114)

    <h3>MOORE, HUMANIDADE, CIVILIZAÇÃO, PROJETO CIVILIZATÓRIO</h3>

Humanity, Civilization, and Nature
are not merely words floating in the ether. They are ruling abstractions, reinvented
since 1492. The geocultural boundary between Humanity and Nature was central
to the New World genocides, to the African slave trade, to modern patriarchy, which
defined the rise of capitalism and its Civilizing Project. Indigenous Peoples, Africans,
and women – all were cast out of Civilization and into a very different realm, Nature.98
Their lives were rendered expendable, and their labor became cheap, on the reasoned
grounds that they were not – or not fully, or not yet – Human (MOORE, 2023, p. 114)

    <h3>MOORE, HUMANO, LINGUAGEM, PRAXIS CIVILIZATÓRIA</h3>

The question of who is – and who is not – Human is therefore at the core of the
climate crisis. It’s fundamental to how modern power is structured and legitimated.
This is not merely a question of language – although language is important. It’s a question of civilizational praxis in which dominant “material” forces are dialectically bound
to “ruling intellectual forces.”99 At the core of that praxis is a knowledge factory that
frames reality as a series of binary and hierarchical oppositions: Humanity/Nature,
Man/Woman, White/Not- White, Europe/America, and so forth (MOORE, 2023, p. 114)

    <h3>MOORE, JUSTIÇA CLIMÁTICA, PODER, ACUMULAÇÃO, ANTROPOCENO POPULAR</h3>

A revolutionary politics of climate justice – one that puts its faith in the world’s
working classes, human and extra‑ human, paid and unpaid – must reimagine our
questions of power, accumulation, and re/production in and through webs of life.
Such a transformation necessarily involves letting go of the colonizers’ ontology of the
world, the divide between Civilization and Savagery, and the Popular Anthropocene’s
Man versus Nature model (MOORE, 2023, p. 115)

    <h3>MOORE, HUMANO, EXTRA-HUMANO, REVOLUÇÃO CARTESIANA</h3>

At every point, we are dealing with relations between human and
extra‑ human natures; every “human” relation is already a socio‑ ecological relationship.
It’s physical. It’s cultural. It’s productive and reproductive. The Cartesian Revolution
dichotomized these – in thought and practice. The Marxist Revolution in thought unifies them within a “rich totality of many determinations”: an “organic whole” of life
and power (MOORE, 2023, p. 116)
