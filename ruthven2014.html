             <h3>RUTHVEN, KRISTEVA, ABJETO, MORTE, CADÁVER</h3>
            
            While Julia Kristeva doubtless did not have in mind the undead corpse of the zombie when she wrote of the abject and how it forces death upon the living, the walking dead undeniably embody abjection (RUTHVEN, 2014, p. 341)
            
             <h3>RUTHVEN, WEBB, BYRNAND, ZUMBI, FANTASIA, HORROR</h3>
            
Even so, it is necessary to ask, as do Jen Webb and Sam Byrnard, "What is this thing called zombie? Although they are, of course, a fantasy, we know enourmous amounts about them" (83). Worth acknowledging, however, is that what we now know as a zombie is a relatively new character in the horror genre. Indeed, there are three types of zombies, only once of which is frequently represented on the screen (RUTHVEN, 2014, p. 342)            
            
             <h3>RUTHVEN, ZUMBI, AGÊNCIA</h3>
            
            The result is that the "ressurected individual is deprived of will, memory, and consciousness, speaks with a nasal voice, and is recognized chiefly by dull, glazed eyes and an absent air (Ackerman ang Gauthier 474) (RUTHVEN, 2014, p. 343)
            
             <h3>RUTHVEN, HORROR, MONSTRO, MORTE</h3>
            
            But the horror of the zombie does not end here. They are also monsters that are frightening because they are constant reminders of what humans wish to forget - the incarnation of death - and the thin line that separates us from them is the very thing that also joins us to them (RUTHVEN, 2014, p. 345)
            
             <h3>RUTHVEN, CONTAMINAÇÃO, ZUMBI, WEBB, BYRNAND, TRANSMISSÃO, VÍRUS</h3>
            
            For the body-in-control to be perceived at risk of contamination by zombies, the similarity between the two bodies (us and them) must be, at least unconsciously, recognized. As Webb and Byrnard note, "The transmission of the 'virus' between us and them indicates our closeness: viruses (mostly) travel between like species" (84) (RUTHVEN, 2014, p. 355)
