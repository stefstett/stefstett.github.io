<h3>ROTHE, ONDA DE CALOR</h3>

In the summer of 2018, a month-long drought plagued large parts of the Northern
Hemisphere. People in the world’s major cities, such as New York and Tokyo, suffered
from a life-threatening heatwave. Across North America and Europe, massive wildfires
were raging. Even Siberia and other parts of the Arctic Circle were on fire. The extreme
weather had a remarkable impact on the public discourse across the Western world. The
summer of 2018, according to the Western media, would allow a brief glimpse into the
planetary future, and give ‘us’ a ‘warning of what we will have to deal with’ (ROTHE, 2020, p. 145)

<h3>ROTHE, ANTROPOCENO, RUPTURA TEMPORAL</h3>

The widely-perceived ‘Planet Politics Manifesto’4 published
in Millennium: Journal of International Studies, for example, argued that the
Anthropocene represents a temporal rupture for the entire discipline. Core beliefs about
the separation of nature and culture, the Cartesian dualism of subject and object, would
crumble against the backdrop of this planetary crisis, thus requiring IR scholars to fundamentally
rethink what we mean by concepts such as security, diplomacy and democracy.
With these assertions, the Manifesto sparked a controversy about international
politics in and for the Anthropocene around the notion of ‘planet politics’ (ROTHE, 2020, p. 145)

<h3>ROTHE, RELIGIÃO, ANTROPOCENO</h3>

In
rearticulating Christian eschatological motifs, the recent debate on the Anthropocene attracts
critiques parallel to those lodged by post-colonial, decolonial, feminist and post-structuralist
scholarship towards IR’s broader theoretical canon (ROTHE, 2020, p. 146)

<h3>ROTHE, ANTROPOCENO, IRREVERSIBILIDADE</h3>

Through the concept of the
Anthropocene, geologic time becomes related to the problem of a human-caused transformation
of the planet, mass extinction and the threat of global ecological collapse. At
the heart of the discourse thus is a linear, eschatological notion of time that brings with it
questions of finitude, irreversibility and temporal ending. Anthropocene discourse thus
paints the picture of a threat that is not only irreversible but also both spatially as well as temporally absolute. (ROTHE, 2020, p. 147-148)

<h3>ROTHE, NARRAÇÃO, TEMPO, POLÍTICA</h3>

However, how that end is narrated and how one relates to the problem
of time running out is contingent. This contingency opens up spaces of political contestation (ROTHE, 2020, p. 148)

<h3>ROTHE, ECOCATASTROFISMO</h3>

Eco-catastrophism is one of the most salient discourses on the Anthropocene.22 Ecocatastrophist
imaginaries of the Anthropocene dwell upon a much older discourse of a
‘green eschatology’ centred around projections of global collapse and the exhaustion of
natural resources that can be traced back to the thinking of the 18th-century economist
and theologist Thomas Robert Malthus (ROTHE, 2020, p. 148)

<h3>ROTHE, ECOCATASTROFISMO, ANTROPOCENO, SISTEMA TERRA</h3>

The planet political project that relates to these eco-catastrophist articulations of the
Anthropocene is one of planetary emergency management through new forms of ‘Earth
system stewardship’.39 Accordingly, urgent international action is required to mitigate a
dangerous state shift in the Earth system. However, existing global environmental governance
is deemed incapable of dealing with the systemic crisis of the Anthropocene because
it breaks down ‘the environment’ into a myriad of different governance objects subject to
an equally large number of related regulations, conventions and mechanisms. Earth system
governance, instead, draws on the idea of the interconnected Earth system as a single
governance object. For this, the epistemic community around the planetary boundaries
model has, for example, called for the establishment of a comprehensive global (carbon)
monitoring system under the umbrella of the United Nations (UN), the extension of Earth
observation and other environmental monitoring capabilities and even the creation of new
international organisations such as a high-level ‘UN Sustainable Development Council’ (ROTHE, 2020, p. 151)

<h3>ROTHE, ECOMODERNISMO</h3>

Eco-modernism represents a second, oppositional approach to the planetary crisis of the
Anthropocene. In contrast to eco-catastrophism, eco-modernism paints a more optimistic
picture of the Anthropocene that stresses not only the human responsibility but also the
human capacity to re-shape the planet (ROTHE, 2020, p. 151)

<h3>ROTHE, ANTROPOCENO, REALISMO PLANETÁRIO</h3>

The third discourse of the Anthropocene, one that I term planetary realism, revolves
around the assumption that the end times are neither near nor far but in fact already taking
place (ROTHE, 2020, p. 153)

<h3>ROTHE, REALISMO PLANETÁRIO, BRUNO LATOUR</h3>

Planetary realists such as Bruno Latour adopt the idea of Gaia and
update it for the current Anthropocene age. For Latour, the Anthropocene would force
humanity to acknowledge our ‘earthboundness’, that is our entanglement in and dependence
on a dynamic Earth system that is beyond our control.60 The philosopher Timothy
Morton is one of the most prominent proponents of the thesis that with the advent of the
Anthropocene the world has already ended: ‘Clearly Planet Earth has not exploded’ he
writes. ‘But the concept world is no longer operational’.61 This assumption reconfirms a
realist position towards the current planetary crisis. As David Chandler argues: ‘It is not
just that “the end of the world is more easily imaginable than the end of capitalism”: it
would appear that “after the end of the world” it is no longer possible even to imagine
any alternative’.62 (ROTHE, 2020, p. 154)

<h3>ROTHE, MUDANÇAS AMBIENTAIS, COSMOLOGIAS INDÍGENAS</h3>

Given the difficulties of
modern scientific methods to anticipate and predict environmental changes at the local
level, planetary realism discourse turns to indigenous forms of knowledge and related
cosmologies. As indigenous cosmologies are perceived as being established through
interaction with nature’s own rhythms, they are considered more appropriate for local
practices of adaptation (ROTHE, 2020, p. 155)

<h3>ROTHE, ESCATOLOGIA, RELIGIÃO</h3>

Eschatology as the Christian doctrine of the last things82 relies on a linear notion of time
as a flow or movement from a starting point (the creation) towards a final event in the
divine plan (the eschaton) (ROTHE, 2020, p. 156)

<h3>ROTHE, ESCATOLOGIA, MODELO LINEAR</h3>

Unlike cyclical time, the linear model of eschatology allowed accounting for progress
and change, to write a human history that distinguished clearly defined periods and
epochs. At the same time, however, a notion of linear time also brought with it the question
of how time will end. There are crucial differences between different Christian
thinkers concerning these questions of the end of times (ROTHE, 2020, p. 156)

<h3>ROTHE, IMAGINÁRIO APOCALÍPTICO</h3>

According to McQueen, the apocalyptic imaginary revolves around five core
beliefs: first, that the end of the world is imminent; second, that the imminent rupture
will be equally cataclysmic and transformative; third, that it will bring an end to an identified
evil; fourth, that it represents a rupture in an otherwise undisrupted linear flow of
history; and, fifth and finally, that it involves the revelation of the secrets written in
heaven (ROTHE, 2020, p. 157)

<h3>ROTHE, ECOCATASTROFISMO, ANTROPOCENO</h3>

For ecocatastrophism,
the threat of climate change is imminent, cataclysmic and represents a temporal
rupture in the planetary history: the transition from the relatively stable Holocene to
the highly dynamic and uncertain Anthropocene epoch.90 Through powerful symbols such
as the planetary carrying capacity or the planetary boundaries the discourse delineates the
time that remains to ward off this cataclysmic transformation. Furthermore, for eco-catastrophists,
the announcement of the Anthropocene is equally revelatory – another feature of
the apocalyptic imaginary identified by McQueen.91 In the eco-catastrophist discourse, the
Anthropocene is ‘already revealing itself as a time of increased suffering’92 – and this suffering
is taken as a sign that urgent intervention is required to save Planet Earth (ROTHE, 2020, p. 158)

<h3>ROTHE, ECOCATASTROFISMO, IMAGINÁRIO CRISTÃO</h3>

By drawing on the framework provided by Dillon, we can identify a further difference
between eco-catastrophism and the Christian apocalyptic imaginary. This difference
concerns the human capability to intervene in the course of history – that is, to arrest,
change or accelerate time (ROTHE, 2020, p. 158)

<h3>ROTHE, ECOCATASTROFISMO, ECOMODERNISMO, ANTROPOCENO, REVELAÇÃO</h3>

Just as for eco-catastrophists, for eco-modernists the Anthropocene represents a moment of
revelation. According to them, the Anthropocene reveals that human and Earth history are
entangled, and that the modernist human/nature dichotomy is but a myth.98 For eco-modernists,
this revelation justifies a comprehensive human project of planetary experimentation (ROTHE, 2020, p. 159)

<h3>ROTHE, REALPOLITIK, ANTROPOCENO, SOFRIMENTO</h3>

The realpolitik of resilience, then, updates the pastoral model of self-government
for the secular era of the Anthropocene and replaces the ‘soteriological finitude’ of the
Christian subject with the ‘factical finitude’ of all living beings.122 Here, human suffering
is neither considered a necessary evil that has to be endured until the completion of
salvation (as in eco-modernism) nor a sign that dramatic actions is needed (as in ecocatastrophism).
In planetary realism and resilience thinking, suffering is not considered
an evil in the first place. Rather, it becomes an essential feature of (finite) life in
the Anthropocene and a driver of learning, adaptation and renewal (ROTHE, 2020, p. 162)
