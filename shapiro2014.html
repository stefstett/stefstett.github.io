             <h3>SHAPIRO, NARRATIVA, ZUMBI, PROGRESSO</h3>
            
            Let me begin with a scandalous claim: there is no such thing as televisual narrative zombie tradition. While there are certainly past instances of zombie representations, which offer a usable set of familiar images and events, it is not useful to read these within a framework of a linear development (a "tradition") that provides a homogeneous or coherent perspective. Each recurrence of zombies is less a <i>recitation</i> or adaptation of the already known than a more or less distinctive <i>repurposing</i> of generic, representational devices to consider a specific contemporary process that generates social uncertainty or crisis (SHAPIRO, 2014, p. 198)
            
             <h3>SHAPIRO, IMPERIALISMO</h3>
            
            The initial zombie cinema typified by <i>White Zombie</i> (1932) or <i>I Walked with a Zombie</i> (1943) seems fascinated by the possibility of American hemispheric imperialism as an enabling solution to the Depression era's failures. These movies seem to wonder if colonized, foreign workers, illustrated by the barely animate zombie, could provide the consumer goods that economic doldrums, wartime rationing, and mass, domestic unemplument were otherwise not allowing Americans to purchase (SHAPIRO, 2014, p. 199)
            
             <h3>SHAPIRO, MEMÓRIA RESIDUAL, TWD</h3>
            
            Rick's wife Lori's caesarian birthing of and subsequent euthanization by her son, Carl; and the palliative-care laboratory at Woodbury, where a scientist tests his hypothesis about possible residual memory in zombies by installing them at the bedside of a soon-to-die elderly man (SHAPIRO, 2014, p. 211)
            
             <h3>SHAPIRO, ZUMBI, ROMERO, BUB, MEMÓRIA RESIDUAL</h3>
            
            Just as zombies parodies helped to facilitate the move toward a larger audience, the incorporation of the zombie's perspective within the viewer's own could not automatically emerge without the presence of precursos works that would ease the ideal viewer into this dual position. First, the father of the modern zombie code, George A. Romero, began investigating the possibility of zombie sentience and qualified recomposition of the human in <i>Day of the Dead</i> (1985) as the zombie Bub recalls sonic patterns and his past gestures. In <i>Land of the Dead</i> (2005), the zombie Big Daddy continued this process and then consciously organized a collective zombie revolt (SHAPIRO, 2014, p. 217)
            
             <h3>SHAPIRO, IAMLEGEND, MASSA, HUMANIDADE</h3>
            
            Matheson's scene [n.a. <i>I Am Legend</i> (2007)] also ends with the narrator wading into the mass, but this gesture is one of the nihilistic suicide, since the narrator acknowledges that as the last human, he is the abnormal: "Normalcy was a majority concept, the standard of many and not the standard of just one man" (SHAPIRO, 2014, p. 220)
            
             <h3>SHAPIRO, TWD, INFECÇÃO, HUMANIDADE, ZUMBI </h3>
            
            Here, AMC's <i>The Walking Dead</i>'s figurative innovation that all humans are infected and will inevitably become zombies illustrates what the American middle class inarticulately senses about its own seemingly inescapable mortification (SHAPIRO, 2014, p. 224)
            
             <h3>SHAPIRO, ZUMBI, HISTÓRIA, CAPITALISMO, CLASSE</h3>
            
            For the zombie's body is both a sign of the existential and historical decline of middle-class authorityand a laboratory of emotional practice for a new structure of feeling as the American middle class begins to recoil in horror from the grasping reach os business interests and toward a new, historical life protocol involving solidarity with those other victims of global capitalism, the working class (SHAPIRO, 2014, p. 225)
