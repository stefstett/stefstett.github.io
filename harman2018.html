<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

In this respect, all of the objects we experience are merely fictions: simplified models of the far more complex objects that continue to exist when I turn my head away from them, not to mention when I sleep or die (HARMAN, 2018, p. 34)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

the reality of things is always withdrawn or veiled rather than directly accessible, and therefore any attempt to grasp that reality by direct and literal language will inevitably misfire (HARMAN, 2018, p. 38)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

The four major pitfalls faced by such a theory [theory of everything] are: <i>physicalism</i>, <i>smallism</i>, <i>anti-fictionalism</i> and <i>literalism</i>.(HARMAN, 2018, p. 39)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

I  like to use the words 'ontology' and 'metaphysics' as synonyms, seeing little benefit in distinguishing them, but much to gain stylistically from treating them as synonyms. Heidegger does not agree. (HARMAN, 2018, p. 42)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

More importantly, my discussion of objects is motivated less by Heidegger than by the Austrian and Polish philosophers immeadiately preceding him, who use the term 'object' in nearly as broad a sense as OOO: Franz Brentano, Kizimirz Twardowski, Edmund Husserl, and Alexius Meinong (HARMAN, 2018, p. 42)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

an object is anything that cannot be entirely reduced either to the components of which it  is made or to the effects that it has on other things. (HARMAN, 2018, p. 43)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

But ultimately there are just two ways of  telling somebody what a thing is: you can tell them what  it is made of, or  tell them what it does, (HARMAN, 2018, p. 43)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Many people will be willing to accept that art is not a means of conveying knowledge, but fewer will concede the point in thje case of philosophy. If philosophy is not a form of knowledge, then what can it possibly be? (HARMAN, 2018, p. 44)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

In the terms of the present book, the pre-Socratics are guilty of 'smallism' (HARMAN, 2018, p. 46)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

For Descartes there are just three kinds of substance in the world: <i>res extensa</i> (physical substance, <i>res cogitans</i> (thinking substance), and God (the sole infinite substance). With the possible exception of God, these substances are not deeplu hidden things, but in principle can be understood perfectly in mathematized form. Physical matter no longer has occult or hidden qualities, but simply a size, a shape and a position and direction of motion, which means that Descartes killed off or overmined the hidden 'substantial forms' of medieval philosophy: meaning not the forrms we see when we look at things, but those which are active deep in the heart of things whether we see them or not (HARMAN, 2018, p. 48)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

In everyday language, the word 'object' often has the connotations of something physical, solid, durable, inhuman or utterly inanimate. In OOO, by contrast, 'object' simply means anything that cannot be reduced either downward or upward, which means anything that has a surplus beyind its constituent pieces and beneath its sum total of effects on the world (HARMAN, 2018, p. 51)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

More generally, for OOO every real event is also a real object (HARMAN, 2018, p. 53)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

To repeat, the only necessary criterion for an object in OOO is that it be irreducible in both directions: an object is more than its pieces and less than its effects (HARMAN, 2018, p. 53)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

[...] ontology that <i>initially</i> treats all objects in the same way, rather than assuming in advance that different types of objects require completely different ontologies. Note that modern philosophy (from Descarrtes in the 1600s through Badiou and Zizek today) is emphatically not flat, since it assumes a strict division between human thought on one side and everything else on the other (HARMAN, 2018, p. 54)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

But all these amazing achievements, even if we assume that animals cannot do anything nearly as complex, and even though we as a species are obviously of special interest to ourselves, do not automatically make human beings worthy of filling up fifty per cent of ontology. This, howeverr, is the verdict of modern philosophy since Descartes and Kant, whose ideas entail that we cannot speak of the world without humans or humans without the world, but only if a primordial correlation or rapporty between the two (HARMAN, 2018, p. 56)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

For one thing, 'facile mysticism' is not the true polar opposite of rationalism. For as different as the two obviously are, the mystic generally claims <i>direct</i> access to reality just as the rationalist does, even though the mystic claims to arrive there through spiritual means rather than intellectual ones (HARMAN, 2018, p. 62)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

First, Kant forbids using <i>someone</i> only as a means to an end at the same time he obviously sees nothing wrong with using <i>non-human objects</i> only as a means to an end (HARMAN, 2018, p. 67)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

The reason Kant views people as free agents having moral worth is because he distinguishes in his philosophy between the visible <i>phenomena</i> of our counscious experience and that he calls the <i>noumena</i>. The phenomena are just what they sound like: everything that humans are able to encounter, perceive, use or think about (HARMAN, 2018, p. 67-68)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

The noumena, by contrast, are things-in-themselves that we never experience directly, since we remain trapped in the conditions of humans experience (HARMAN, 2018, p. 68)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Usually the noumena are ignored in all cases other then ethics: after all, why waste time talking about things-in-themselves that lie beyond all human access? Ortega's great innovation in the metaphor essay is to show that the things-in-themselves are of crucial importance for the arts. This is something that Kant's own philosophy of art never really attempted, since Kant was obsessed with the universal structure of human taste, and was less interested in the structure of art objects themselves (HARMAN, 2018, p. 69)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

It follows that every non-human object can also be called an 'I' in the sense of having a definite inwardness that can naver fully be grasped. For even if we say that 'this red leather box that I have before me is not an "I" because it is only an image I have', the box is not only something phenomenal for me (HARMAN, 2018, p. 70)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Although Hume - for example - is known as a sceptic, he actually defines objects in a way that reduces them to the correlates of possible knowledge: there is no such thing as an 'apple', but only a number of palpable qualities such as red, hard, juicy, sweet and cold, all of which seem to appear together so often that we loosely refer to this 'bundle of qualities' as an 'apple' (HARMAN, 2018, p. 76)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Since Ortega led us to the formulation that art is an object-quality tension of the type RO-SQ (real objects-sensual qualities), we have the problem of knowing exactly what plays the role of RO in the mataphor 'the sypress is a flame' (HARMAN, 2018, p. 82)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

For if the real cypress is just as absent from the metaphor as it is from thought and perrception, there is nonetheless one real object that is never absent from our experience of art: namely, <i>we ourselves</i> (HARMAN, 2018, p. 82-83)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

First, metaphor does not try to give us thoughts or perceptions about an object (HARMAN, 2018, p. 86)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Second, metaphors are non-reciprocal (HARMAN, 2018, p. 86)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Third, metaphors are assymetrical (HARMAN, 2018, p. 86)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Fourth, [...] the only object prepared for duty is the real object that each of us is him- or herself (HARMAN, 2018, p. 87)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Fifth and finally, metaphor is an act of coupling rather than uncoupling (HARMAN, 2018, p. 87)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

As apparently dead ends in career terms (despite frequent articles to the effect that 'employers actually prefer philosophy graduates') the humanities in our time are always on the verge of major budget cuts (HARMAN, 2018, p. 93)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

The roots of aesthetic formalism can be found in the philosophy of Kant. But since he only uses that term explicitly in his ethics, we should begin briefly there (HARMAN, 2018, p. 94)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

In principle, a lie cannot be justified by the fact that it happens to save ten busloads of refugees from the death squads at the border (HARMAN, 2018, p. 95)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Among other things, Scheler is attentive to the varying ethical vocations found in different human beings. Although he admiringly salutes what he calls the sublime and empty coldness of Kant's ethical universe, Scheler notes the highly specific ethical codes that belong only to certain people, professions or nations (HARMAN, 2018, p. 95)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

This is possible because, for Kant, all humans have the same 'transcendental faculty of judgement', just as we all experience the world in terms of cause and effect rather than as disconnected random incidents (HARMAN, 2018, p. 97)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Here again we see the <i>true</i> meaning of formalism for Kant. It is not just a question of autonomy, but of a specific autonomy of two domains that are separate from one another: humans and world (HARMAN, 2018, p. 97)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

But while they remain 'formalists' in Kant's sense of the term - despite their evident dislike for the word - that they give us is a backwards formalism in which the 'world' side of the equation matters more than the 'thought' side (HARMAN, 2018, p. 98)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

More generally, Fried confuses two separate roles of the human being in any given situation. In one sense we are merely observers, the knights of anti-realism, since we reduce the things we encounter to mere caricatures incommensurable with their genuine depth (HARMAN, 2018, p. 100)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Yet in a second sense, humans are also the knights of realism, since we are always the  only real objects on the scene (despite our inability to <i>see</i> ourselves directly), given that cypresses, flames and red boxes are never directly graspable by us or by anything else (HARMAN, 2018, p. 101)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

There was the discovery that art is not the production of knowledge about things, but that it creates new things-in-themselves (HARMAN, 2018, p. 105)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

What interests OOO, instead, is the way that my encounterr with a flame or an ethical vocation forms a <i>new object in its own right</i>, and not just an external interaction between two permanently suparate entities (HARMAN, 2018, p. 107)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

That is to say, any situation is best understood simply by assessing which beings are having an impact, and following them closely in all that they do instead of assuming that we already know what they are in advance (HARMAN, 2018, p. 108)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

But OOO is even more indebted to the work of the late Lynn Margulis, who distinguishes between moments of gradual change and moments of <i>symbiosis</i> between separate organisms, in which change leads to an organism different in kind from its predecessors (HARMAN, 2018, p. 111)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Now, someone might begin by asking in what sense a war can be an object. It is not, instead, an 'event' that involves a number of different objects? But recall that for OOO an object need not be physical, solid, simple, inanimate or durable; it need only be irreducible either downward to its components or upward to its effects (HARMAN, 2018, p. 114)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

As already mentioned, OOO focuses instead on several stages in the development of an object: stages triggered for the most part not by internal developments, but by symbiotic transformation (HARMAN, 2018, p. 119)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

But what do we mean by the maturity of an object? OOO social theory holds that an object is mature as soon as it has no room for further symbiosis (HARMAN, 2018, p. 120)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

One clue that will be of assistance is that a symbiosis occurs between two pre-existing objects, with 'events' being only the unmistakable echo of these objects in their interaction (HARMAN, 2018, p. 125)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

For various reasons I suspect that most objects, of no matterr what scale -- and whether human or non-human -- will pass through roughly a half-dozen symbioses before reaching mature form (HARMAN, 2018, p. 125)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

We turn now from people to places, and here our choices of symbiosis may be more surprising (HARMAN, 2018, p. 128)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Symbiosis marks an irreversible change in the life of an object, and must therefore be distinguished from relations that change nothing (HARMAN, 2018, p. 134)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

In his early career, up through 1991, Latour was a remorseless power politician, his youthful writing filled with lively praise for Machiavelli and Hobbes. No figure in Latour's early work is treated as more pathetic than the moralist: the one who opposes 'right' to 'might'. This phase only ends with <i>We Have Never Been Modern</i>, a turning point in Latour's career (HARMAN, 2018, p. 139)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

This is what Latour calls 'object-oriented politics', and he was right to borrow this metaphor from OOO, which feels very much at home with this model of the political (HARMAN, 2018, p. 142)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Modern political theory has two major features. First, it claims to have political <i>knowledge</i>, even if it is only the knowledge that there is no truth and everything is a ruthless struggle for power (HARMAN, 2018, p. 143)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

As a general rule, those of the Left (like Rousseau) imagine the state of nature as a time of equality and co-operation, while those of the Right (like Hobbes) conceive it as a brutal war of all against all (HARMAN, 2018, p. 143)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Whether or not you think humans are naturally good, the printing press is a bigger political actor than any human, so too is the atomic bomb, and -- we are soon to discover -- so is the melting of the polar ice caps (HARMAN, 2018, p. 143)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

There [Chapter 02] I claimed that aesthetic phenomena result whenever a wedge is driven between an object and its qualities. To be more specific, it was a matter of real objects -- withheld, inaccessible, concealed -- vanishing from the scene while their qualities remained visible, accessible, and always revealed (HARMAN, 2018, p. 149)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

left-wing Truth Politics (Rousseau, Marx), right-wing Truth Politics (Strauss), left-wing Power Politics (various postmodernist: Foucault, Butler), and right-wing Power Politics (Machiavelli, Schmitt) (HARMAN, 2018, p. 151)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Phenomenal experience shows us numerous different qualities by which we distinguish between different things (HARMAN, 2018, p. 153)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

OOO counters Husserrl by denying that intellectual intuition can grasp things as they are any better than sensual intuition does (HARMAN, 2018, p. 157)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Yet OOO speaks not just of a duality of space and time, but of a quadriplicity (HARMAN, 2018, p. 158)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

"ontography" (HARMAN, 2018, p. 161)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

for according to this theory, two real objects in the world make contact not through direct impact, but only by way of the fictional images they present to each other (HARMAN, 2018, p. 163)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Now, Hume and Kant certainly do not agree with the occasionalist view that causation must always have God as a mediator. But what they do share in common with occasionalism is the view that <i>one special entity in particular</i> is the site of causation: namely, the human mind (HARMAN, 2018, p. 165)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

More interesting for our purposes is the distinction Socrates draws between that a thing is and what qualities it possesses (HARMAN, 2018, p. 171)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Through a series of questions he [Socrates] then leads Meno to the same conclusion: there are no teachers of virtue, because it is not a form of knowledge (HARMAN, 2018, p. 175)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

First, Socrates dows not think that knowing a thing if the same as knowing its qualities (HARMAN, 2018, p. 177)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Second, Socrates refuses the idea that we either know a thing or we do not (HARMAN, 2018, p. 177)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Third and finally, virtue -- like <i>philosophia</i>, or anything else for which there are no teachers -- is not a form of knowledge, but a 'gift from the gods' (HARMAN, 2018, p. 177)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

being both justified and true is not a sufficient condition for a belief being counted as knowledge (HARMAN, 2018, p. 179)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

This is why it makes sense to call aesthetics a case of 'unjustified true belief', though one that is not a form of knowledge, as Sartwell's 'true belief' boldly claims to be (HARMAN, 2018, p. 181)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

This is why knowledge does not require the same degree of personal absorption as aestheric experience: we can look on dispassionately at a rriddle of knowledge rather than constantly sustaining it with our own being as we must in aesthetics (HARMAN, 2018, p. 183)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Finally, we said that knowledge must be 'justified untrue belief'. The 'untrue' part is easy, since it is clear that we are dealing with a reality that eludes un rather than a directly accessible truth; the 'justified' part is lees immediately clear. And above all, the real qualities grasped in knowledge cannot come from the object ifself, but must come from the beholder, whose reality (just as in the aesthetic case) is the only one there on the scene rather than withdrawn (HARMAN, 2018, p. 185)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

It is axiomatic for OOO that no direct access to the reality of this hospital is possible, since that would require that my own relation to its excellence would be the same thing as that excellence itself: as if carbon were nothing more than the role it plays for oxigen in carbon dioxide (HARMAN, 2018, p. 186)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

For more than a century, philosophy in the West has been polarized between two parallel traditions: the Anglo-American and the continental European, usually called 'analytis' and 'continental' for short (HARMAN, 2018, p. 197)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

The word grammatology refers to a proposed 'science of writing', though he claims that the momentum for such a science has long been builing outside his own work (HARMAN, 2018, p. 199)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

This is where Derrida inserts himself into the discussion. He dissents from Socrates' views on the privilege of the living voice, since for Derrida the worship of presence is the cardinal error of the entire Western intellectual tradition. As he sees it, there is no pure presence anywhere (HARMAN, 2018, p. 200)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

For Derrida, everything is caught up in a chain or system of differences; contra OOO, there is no autonomous reality apart from this system, which is a purely immanent surface with nothing 'deep' hiding behind it (HARMAN, 2018, p. 203)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

For us, the difference between the metaphorical and the literal has to do with whether the bond between the object and its qualities is sucessfully severed (metaphorical) or whether the object is loosely or explicitly identified with those qualities (literal) (HARMAN, 2018, p. 204)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Namely, he [Derrida] (1) tries to abolish the real object in favour of a collection of differential sensual qualities and (2) completely ignorres the difference between the thing as object and the thing as qualities, without which genuine metaphor is impossible (HARMAN, 2018, p. 205)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Accompanying Derrida's rejection of isolated individual entities is his rejection of <i>words</i> as the basic units of language (HARMAN, 2018, p. 207)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

To summarize, Derrida has such animus against realism that he misses the considerable dose of it that can be found in Heidegger's philosophy (HARMAN, 2018, p. 208)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Derrida is a holistic anti-realist who thinks that all language is metaphorical; OOO is an anti-holistic realism which views the distiction between the literal and the metaphorical as one of the key oppositions for philosophy and for everything else (HARMAN, 2018, p. 209)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

I have always preferred Latour to Foucault, and suspect the the intellectual world may soon come to agree with me. The reason for this is Latour's far greater ability to deal with inanimate reality alongside the human sphere (HARMAN, 2018, p. 210)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

From these indisputable phenomena, Foucault hastily concludes that such decisions are 'constructed', meaning that they are constructed by <i>people</i> rather than provided directly by the object of study itself (HARMAN, 2018, p. 212)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

In other words, that Foucault offers is not an object-oriented ontology, but one of its most frequently proposed alternatives: an <i>event</i>-oriented ontology (HARMAN, 2018, p. 213)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

But methods are forms of <i>knowledge</i>, and as such they are either overmining methods (as with Foucault and Latour) or undermining methods (as with Dennett's preference for exact chemical formulae over morer poetic methods of wine tasting) (HARMAN, 2018, p. 214-215)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

Latour begins with a 'flat ontology' that erases the distinction between subject and object as an obsession of modern philosophy. This is precisely what makes Latour a <i>non-modern</i> thinker, to use a valuable term he coined himself (HARMAN, 2018, p. 217)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

<i>Flat Ontology</i> (Chapter 1). This is the idea that philosophy must <i>begin</i> by casting the widest possible net in aspiring to talk about everything (HARMAN, 2018, p. 256)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

This is why OOO, using Latour's term, calls itself a 'non-modern' philosophy, since we have no wish to return to the pre-modern era and merely reject thought/world or human/non-human as a purportedly basic distiction that wrongly cuts the universe in half (HARMAN, 2018, p. 256-257)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

<i>Anti-mining</i> (Chapter 1). An object is whatever cannot be reduced to either of the two basic kinds of knowledge: what something is made of, and what it does (HARMAN, 2018, p. 257)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

<i>OOO is not a form of materialism</i> (Chapter 1). Any new theory will tend to attract a number of differrent misunderstandings (HARMAN, 2018, p. 258)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

<i>Objects withhold themselves not just from human acess, but from each other as well</i> (Chapter 1). This is the important way in which OOO differs from Kant, and from important Kantian heirs such as Heidegger (HARMAN, 2018, p. 259)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

<i>The fracture in things</i> (Chapter 2). Most debates about realism obsess over the single gab between reality and our representations of it. Along with breadening this question so that thinking humans are no longer the sole locus of these rrepresentations, OOO adds another twist to the problem (HARMAN, 2018, p. 259)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

<i>Aesthetics as first philosophy</i> (Chapter 2). Aesthetic experience is crucial to OOO as a form of non-literal access to the object (HARMAN, 2018, p. 260)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

<i>Objects act because they exist, rather than existing because they act</i> (Chapter 3). Social theory must be based on the <i>reality</i> of objects, not on their <i>actions</i>, since the latter can only overmine the objects themselves (HARMAN, 2018, p. 260)

<h3>HARMAN, </h3>

<i>there is no political knowledge</i> (Chapter 3). Political theory cannot be based on a claim to knowledge: whether it be the supposed knowledge of what the best polity is, or merely the cynical claim that it's all just a struggle for power (HARMAN, 2018, p. 260)
