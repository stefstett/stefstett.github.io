<h3>MURPHY, CARTOGRAFIA, COLONIALISMO</h3>

According to popular lore, hic sunt dracones, “here be dragons,” is a
Latin phrase found frequently on ancient maps. Though, in fact, the
phrase rarely occurs (the Hunt-Lenox Globe, dated to 1510 CE, is the
one oft-cited example, but as scholars routinely note, it’s on a globe
rather than an ancient paper map), fearsome creatures have crowded
our maps throughout history. For example, the warning hic abundant
leones, “here lions abound,” is found on the Cotton Tiberius map from
1025 CE, while a dragon appears among other wild animals on the
Ebstorf Map (Fig. 21.1). Other old maps include drawings of strange
looking animals, giant sea creatures, or warnings that “in these places
scorpions are born” (found on the Tabula Peutingeriana, a medieval copy
of a Roman map) (MURPHY, 2016, p. 470)


<h3>MURPHY, MONSTRO, CONHECIMENTO</h3>

Monsters, then, are intricately connected to knowledge: to the world
we know and the world we do not, to what we fear. (For more on
monsters and religion more broadly, see Beal 2002.) (MURPHY, 2016, p. 471)


<h3>MURPHY, ZUMBIS, FRONTEIRA</h3>

Zombies function much in the same way that dragons, lions, or
otherwise fearsome beasts functioned on ancient maps, by “dwell[ing]
on the threshold between the known and unknown, this world and
its otherworldly beyond” (Beal, 194). They help us to grapple with the
space that often exists between our expectations of the world and the
way we actually experience the world. (MURPHY, 2016, p. 472)


<h3>MURPHY, ZUMBIS</h3>

As <b>James Lowder</b> writes, “All zombies are created
equal. All zombie stories are not. The best ones, like The Walking Dead,
get into your head and make you think—make you fatten up the gray
matter that the living dead lust after so ravenously” (Lowder 2011,
xii). In short, the answer is in how these stories, both ancient and
contemporary, make us think.(MURPHY, 2016, p. 473)


<h3>MURPHY, ZUMBIS, BÍBLIA </h3>

There are no zombies in the Bible. Sure, Ezekiel brings to life a
valley of dried bones (Ezek 37), and the book of Daniel promises that
“many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to
everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt” (12:2).
Jesus revives his friend Lazarus from the dead (John 11), and upon
Jesus’s death in Matthew’s Gospel, we read that the tombs opened up
and “many bodies” rose and eventually entered Jerusalem (Matt
27:52–53). (MURPHY, 2016, p. 473)


<h3>MURPHY, MONSTRO, ZUMBIS, REVELAÇÃO, RELIGIÃO </h3>

The monsters we fantasize about (zombies or otherwise) reveal to us
something about ourselves (Cohen 1996, 4; Beal 2002, 6–7). At first
glance, there might not seem to be anything particularly religious
about the zombies we see in our pop culture apocalyptic stories. Yet,
though we often think of monsters as “demonic or ‘evil,’” in fact,
“the monster’s religious import is rooted in the word itself: ‘monster’
derives from the Latin monstrum, which is related to the verbs monstrare
(‘show’ or ‘reveal’) and monere (‘warn’ or ‘portend’), and which
sometimes refers to a divine portent that reveals the will or judgment
of God or the gods” (Beal 2002, 6–7). Hence, etymologically, a
“monstrum is a message that breaks into this world from the realm of
the divine” (Beal 2002, 7). In short, it is not the monster itself that
matters—rather it is what the monster reveals, its message or warning.
As apocalypses reveal, so too do monsters. (MURPHY, 2016, p. 474)


<h3>MURPHY, MONSTRO, BÍBLIA, IMAGINÁRIO OCIDENTAL</h3>

If the monstrous beasts in the book of Daniel are symbolic, then
what is the message of the monsters we call zombies? Unlike many
of the other monsters that have captured Western imagination (e.g.,
vampires or werewolves), the zombie is unique in that it did not
develop in Europe (McIntosh 2008; Dendle 2010; Kee 2011). Rather, the
history behind the (now often thoroughly Americanized) zombie
begins with vodoun, a religious tradition of West Africa and Haiti. The
earliest ideas of the zombie in American thought had nothing to do
with the flesh-eating zombies who roam in hordes on The Walking Dead,
which follows a now routine series of events found in zombie stories all across the contemporary world—some kind of infection (often
unexplained) occurs, turning the recently dead into mindless creatures
that roam about searching for human flesh (and, sometimes,
specifically brains), and the bite of one of these infected human-butnot-
quite-human creatures turns others into the same. Although the
exact etymology of the English word zombie is unknown, zombie
scholars largely agree that the word itself is West African in origin, and
that it entered American English via Haiti, where many West Africans
were enslaved and/or oppressed during French and subsequent US
occupation of the island. According to Shawn McIntosh, “The word
likely comes either from a tribe from Gabon called the Mitsogho, who
have the term ndzumbi, cadaver of the dead, or from the Kongo nzambi,
which means ‘spirit of a dead person’” (McIntosh, “The Evolution of
the Zombie” [2008], 2). The origins of the term are related to the dead,
but not to the cannibalistic walking dead of contemporary American
television and movie screens. (MURPHY, 2016, p.475-476)


<h3>MURPHY, THE WALKING DEAD, ZUMBIS, APOCALIPSE </h3>

Though it might not at first glance seem to be the case, the television
series The Walking Dead has, in some ways, always been about hope:
from the outset, Rick hopes he would find his family, that he would
find them a safe place to thrive in the aftermath of the apocalypse,
and that some kind of just and merciful society might be rebuilt out
of the wreckage of the post-apocalyptic world. This is the impetus
that drives Rick from his hospital bed and into the streets of Atlanta,
searching for his missing wife and child. In the fourth season, hope
in the face of a zombie apocalypse is at the forefront of the show,
especially as the group experiences one devastating loss after another. (MURPHY, 2016, p. 490)


<h3>MURPHY, ZUMBIS, REVELAÇÃO, COLONIZAÇÃO, CAPITALISMO</h3>

Zombies, too, reveal much about the context and situations
of their creators as well as their audiences—from the real life effects
of colonization, the ways in which racism renders survival hopeless,
or the fact that we might live in a world that we see only through the
screens of our computers and smartphones. (MURPHY, 2016, p. 492)
