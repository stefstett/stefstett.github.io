             <h3>HASSLER-FOREST, ZUMBI, CULTURA</h3>
            
            Over the past decade the zombie has been transformed from a movie monster that appeared primarily in American underground cinema and Italian horror films to a ubiquitous trope in popular culture (HASSLER-FOREST, 2014, p. 116)
            
             <h3>HASSLER-FOREST, DELEUZE E GUATTARI, MITO, CAPITALISMO</h3>
            
            The rise of the zombie as what Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari have described as our culture's "only modern myth" (<i>Anti-Oedipus</i> 368) has been accompanied by a simultaneous and insistent foregrounding of urban life as the strongest single unifying concept in capitalist societies (HASSLER-FOREST, 2014, p. 117)
            
             <h3>HASSLER-FOREST, METÁFORA</h3>
            
            As a figure that literizes the contradictions inherent in dialectical thinking, it can be put to any number of allegorical uses: the zombie has stood for mindless consumerism (<i>Dawn of the Dead</i>), viral contagion (<i>28 Days Later</i>), the civil rights struggle (<i>Night of the Living Dead</i>), and even the theoretical anxieties of poststructuralism and the linguistic turn (<i>Pontypool</i>) (HASSLER-FOREST, 2014, p. 119)
            
             <h3>HASSLER-FOREST, ZUMBI, CIDADE, MARX, DIALÉTICA, HARVEY, DESCARTES</h3>
            
            In order to map out the correspondence between the zombie and the city, I employ Marx's appropriation of Hegelian dialectics, which Harvey describes succinctly as a "process in which the Cartesian separations between mind and matter, between thought and action, between counsciousness and materiality, beween theory and practice have no purchase (<i>Justice</i> 48) (HASSLER-FOREST, 2014, p. 123)
            
             <h3>HASSLER-FOREST, ZUMBI, APOCALIPSE, CIDADE, MODERNO</h3>
            
            From this perspective, the zombie apocalypse, while obviously traumatic, fulfills the nostalgic desire to break free from the decadent unreality of modern urban life (HASSLER-FOREST, 2014, p. 124)
            
             <h3>HASSLER-FOREST, HORROR, MITO, LACAN, REAL</h3>
            
            The horror genre, perhaps more than any other type of popular mythology, thus provides a relatively safe environment in which viewers can navigate the tension between fear and prohibited desire, charting the gap between the Lacanian realms of the Symbolic and the Real (HASSLER-FOREST, 2014, p. 126)
            
             <h3>HASSLER-FOREST, HORROR, PROBIÇÃO, PRAZER</h3>
            
            The appeal of the horror narrative and its complex structure of feeling thus lies to a large extent in its ambiguous negotiation of prohibitions and its staging of scenarious that are simultaneously terrifying and deeply pleasurable (HASSLER-FOREST, 2014, p. 126)
            
             <h3>HASSLER-FOREST, ZUMBI, CIDADE, RELAÇÃO, CONTRADIÇÃO</h3>
            
            Like the zombie, neither the country nor the city therefore has a true center that defines its meaning independently of other categories; instead, they exist only in relation to each other in a complex process of mutual and internal contradiction (HASSLER-FOREST, 2014, p. 127)

             <h3>HASSLER-FOREST, IAMLEGEND, MODERNO, COLONIAL, HUMANIDADE, ANIMAL</h3>
            
            Robert Neville is similarly isolated in <i>I Am Legend</i>. The barbaric hordes that surround him may not be native islanders but vampiric zombies, which we should understand first and foremost as "completely realized colonial subjects" operating under a "colonial gaze" that is all but identical to that of Defoe's early modern mercantilism (Canavan 437). The way zombies are represented in fiction as objectified and dehumanized bodies is all but identical to the way colonial subjects were conceived of in imperialist literature: as disposable, distinctly monstrous shapes that occupied an ambiguous space between human and animal (HASSLER-FOREST, 2014, p. 128)
            
             <h3>HASSLER-FOREST, NOTLD, ZUMBI </h3>
            
            As defined by the oft-repeated narrative framework of <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>, zombie films more frequently foregound a breakdown of traditional narratives structures and may even be considered a form of antinarrative in several important ways. The European zombie films of the 1970s and 1980s are especially notable for consisting of little more than a series of intense and violent zombie attacks, strung together by a tenuous narrative chain (HASSLER-FOREST, 2014, p. 130)
            
             <h3>HASSLER-FOREST, ZUMBI, CIDADE</h3>
            
            But although the zombie threat can appear in any environment, from the urban to the rural, the type of subjectivity the zombie represents is fundamentally postmodern and therefore defined by a type of consciousness that destabilizes the urban/rural distinction (HASSLER-FOREST, 2014, p. 131)
            
             <h3>HASSLER-FOREST, CAPITALISMO, CONSUMO, CIDADE, INFAMILIAR</h3>
            
            But the lack of counsciousness displayed by all but a very few zombie characters goes much further than a straightforward satirical depiction of late capitalism consumerism. The mindless, slouching form of the undead ghoul, moving in crowds down city streets or across rural pastures, is also the uncanny embodiment of the city dweller as described in Georg Simmel in 1903. In his essay "The Metropolis and Mental Life", he writes that "the reaction of the metropolitan person... is moved to a sphere of mental activity which is least sensitive and which is furthest removed from the depths of the personality (HASSLER-FOREST, 2014, p. 132)
            
             <h3>HASSLER-FOREST, ZUMBI, EPIDEMIA, HUMANIDADE</h3>
            
            But at the same time, the emergence of the zombie epidemic is also the catalyst that forces these texts' human survivors to break out of their own blasé-ness and engage with a more urgent reality (HASSLER-FOREST, 2014, p. 133)
            
             <h3>HASSLER-FOREST, CIDADE, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            This claustrophobic urban geography is illustrated all too frequently in the most popular zombie texts (HASSLER-FOREST, 2014, p. 134)
            
             <h3>HASSLER-FOREST, CONTRADIÇÃO, MODERNO, ZUMBI, APOCALIPSE</h3>
            
            As a figure that exists in a state of perpetual contradiction, the zombie appears as both the symptom of and the remedy for this modern urban disease: while the zombie can be read as the parodic incarnation of the urban subject's total indifference to the distinction between things, the apocalyptic zombie plague also forces the human protagonists to abandon this frivolous blasé-ness and emerge Robinson Crusoe-like as survivalists (HASSLER-FOREST, 2014, p. 135)
            
             <h3>HASSLER-FOREST, NEOLIBERAL, COLONIALISMO, BROOKS, IAMLEGEND</h3>
            
            But just as neoliberal discourse has managed to seal off the specter of disposable labor and neocolonialism, <i>The Zombie Survival Guide</i> moves away from the ironic ambiguity that has dominated the genre from <i>I Am Legend</i> onward, concentrating instead on the pragmatic individual's sucessful navigation of this new world of the undead (HASSLER-FOREST, 2014, p. 141)
            
             <h3>HASSLER-FOREST, ZUMBI, NEOLIBERALISMO, ROMERO, </h3>
            
            While many zombie films dramatize this overriding concern with domestic security in various consistent ways, <i>Land of the Dead</i> (2005) makes the development of the neoliberal city its overriding thematic concern. This fourth installment in Romero's ongoing "<i>Dead</i>" film cycle is the first to abandon the usual motiv of having a small group attemption. Instead, <i>Land of the Dead</i> attempts to sketch out a postapocalyptic social and political order that reflects the growing distinction between rich and poor in the neoliberal metropolis (HASSLER-FOREST, 2014, p. 143)
