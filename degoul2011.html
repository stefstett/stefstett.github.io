             <h3>DEGOUL, HAITI, ZUMBI, HOLLYWOOD</h3>
            
            Further, it is during the American occupation of Haiti in the first third of the twentieth century that the figure of the Haitian zombie, and with it the "phenomenon" of zombification, enters into quasi-anthropological literature, as well as HollYwood and eventually European cinema (DEGOUL, 2011, p. 24)
            
             <h3>DEGOUL, HAITI</h3>
            
            The Haitian indigenous movement, born precisely in reaction against the American occupation, tentatively boasts the successful production of an auto-image opposed to the depreciative hetero-image - of Vaudou, and of Haitian folklore - constructed by Westerners under the category of travel writing (DEGOUL, 2011, p. 25)
            
             <h3>DEGOUL, HAITI, VOOODOO, RACISMO </h3>
            
            Haiti is thus instantiated as a country of Vaudou, sacrifices, and barbarism in this representation of the black sorcerer and the young white female that he chooses as his victim, who "needs to be saved from zombification in order that she not be assaulted by racially impure hands." The American imagination appropriates, then, a theme that issued from the Haitian imagination, racializes and eroticizes it, all the while associating it in quasi-symbolic fashion with Haitian situation, with Negro Haitianness more broadly, as marked by witchcraft (DEGOUL, 2011, p. 27)
            
             <h3>DEGOUL, ALTERIDADE, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO, BRANCOS, CIVILIZAÇÃO, HAITI</h3>
            
            In this interplay of Same and Other, which can be reduced to the interplay between us and them, the practice of zombification (attributed, fantasized, generalized) constitutes a fundamental sign of distinction between Americans - of white race, the possessors of civilization - and Haitians - of African origin, bloodthirty barbarians (DEGOUL, 2011, p. 28)
            
             <h3>DEGOUL, ALTERIDADE</h3>
            
            As the anthropologist Paul Farmer points out, we distinguish in these negative representations of the Other, in political discourses as well as in leterary and cinematographical expression, a process of "blaming the victim" (DEGOUL, 2011, p. 28)
            
             <h3>DEGOUL, HAITI, OCUPAÇÃO, BRANCOS </h3>
            
            Haiti had been occupied, but it defended itself by means of zombification, a practice that scared the "blancs" - that is to say, in the Haitian sense of the term, the "outsiders". This anecdote is conjoined to the very principle of "occupation", testifying that one of the first generals of the American army to have walked on Haitian soil was transformed into a zombie. This first step onto Haitian soil becomes a symbol of the sudden emergence of whites in the affairs of the first black republic in the world, and a symbol of this violation of its sovereignty (DEGOUL, 2011, p. 29)
            
             <h3>DEGOUL,ZUMBIFICAÇÃO </h3>
            
            Americans make weapons, but us, our weapon is the principle of zombification! In the same way, if we cannot zombify you, if we see that we cannot zombify you, we'll try another route that we call 'pyès', that we call 'powders' (DEGOUL, 2011, p. 31-32)
            
             <h3>DEGOUL, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO, HAITI </h3>
            
            It is thus that we must regard zombification, as it can be interpreted in Haiti, as a cultural trait used by certain Haitians to mark a fundamental difference between Haiti and the surrounding nations with whom it has, or has had in the past, less peaceble relations, as in the cases with the Dominican Republic and the United States (DEGOUL, 2011, p. 32).
            
             <h3>DEGOUL, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO, CULTURA, HAITI </h3>
            
            Zombification from the outside observer's point of view and as a cultural practice, demonstrated Haitian barbarism and, simultaneously, served as a deep founding anchor at the heart of this relationshop, establishing the racial and cultural difference of the Haitian people (DEGOUL, 2011, p. 33)
            
             <h3>DEGOUL, HAITI, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO, VOODOO </h3>
            
            Zombification, as a symbol of negative Haitianness - an exogenous vision centering on barbarism - is transformed into a symbol of positive Haitianness. This positive Haitianness is an endogenous vision focusing on the national power conferred by zombification and foundational knowledge of the Vaudou religion, as the objects of a particularly vibrant and intense strategy of protection and preservation (DEGOUL, 2011, p. 38).
