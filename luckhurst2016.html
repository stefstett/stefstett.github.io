<h3>LUCKHURST, ROMERO, HORROR, CANIBAL</h3>
Romero spawned an army of imitators, particularly in the European horror industry. It is in the sequence of films from horror cinema's glorious decade of perverse wonders, that the zombie came together as a relentless, devouring, cannibalistic creature driven by insatiable hunger to turn living  flesh into dead meat. (LUCKHURST, 2016:137)

<h3>LUCKHURST, ROMERO</h3>
Ît is oddly appropriate that this film was effectively public property from the start, given that it seemed to have a direct channel into the collective unconscious (LUCKHURST, 2016:140)

<h3>LUCKHURST, HORROR</h3>
Ŵhat you want from a horror film is a dangerous sense that rules will be broken^(LUCKHURST, 20016:142)

<h3>LUCKHURST, FANON, IMPERIALISMO</h3>
American student radicals would turn to violence modelled on an understanding of its revolutionary necessity to overthrouw imperial power, as outlined in the writings of Frantz Fanon, the Black Panthers and others. (LUCKHURST, 2016:142)

<h3>LUCKHURST, ROMERO, </h3>
“After “Night” [of the living dead], all zombies seem solely motivated to devour the living without purpose, to turn the would into an undifferentiated mass of deadened sameness” (LUCKHURST, 2016:143)

<h3>LUCKHURST, ROMERO, ZUMBI, HUMANO</h3>
“The increasingly declarative message of Romero’s film sequence will be: the zombies are us.” (LUCKHURST, 2016:145)

<h3>LUCKHURST, ZUMBI, CAPITALISMO, ROMERO, DAWN </h3>
“The Zombie, after the 2008 financial crash, has been declared ‘the official monster of the recession’, the image of the suckered global poor’. All of these readings are ultimately rooted in the heavy-handed satire of Dawn’s shopping mall sequences, when the muzak, fountains and escalators are turned back on and the dumb zombies totter around the shops in a shambolic instinctual repetition of ingrained habit” (LUCKHURST, 2016:149-150)

<h3>LUCKHURST, ZUMBI, DAWN, ROMERO</h3>
“They’re not after us. They’re after the place.” (LUCKHURST, 2016:150)

<h3>LUCKHURST, MALL, ZUMBI</h3>
“‘Braddock is like the land that time forgot. It looks like somebody just bombed it and didn’t clean it up… People look like zombies.’ The rise of shopping malls in de-industrialized areas is the starkest emblem of a shift from Fordist production to low-wage, de-skilled service industries floating on the whims of international capital.” (LUCKHURST, 2016:151)

<h3>LUCKHURST, ZUMBI, DAWN, CAPITALISMO</h3>
“This is a powerful undertow in “Dawn” [of the Dead], but there remains something problematically smug about the subject position the film invites people to adopt: by definition, you are not the zombie, you are not fooled by this ideological mystification or a part of this mindless mass, you can resist this interpellation into the casino of consumption capitalism.” (LUCKHURST, 2016:151)

<h3>LUCKHURST, CAPITALISMO, </h3>
Cultural theorist still talked about malls as zones of mass distraction into the 1990s, dreamworlds of capitalism, from which to awake required the jolt of radical critique” (LUCKHURST, 2016:151)

<h3>LUCKHURST, ZUMBI, ESCRAVO, CAPITALISMO</h3>
‘They’re learning how to work together’. ‘Big Daddy’, a zombified black garage mechanic, grasps the nature of their servitude and leads the masses on a march to target their exploitative human masters, now holed up in a luxury mall where all of America’s class inequalities have been preserved intact.” (LUCKHURST, 2016:154)

<h3>LUCKHURST, ROMERO, DAWN, CAPITALISMO</h3>
“IN many ways, Romero’s films track this collapse of the public sphere in America: by racial division in Night, consumerism in Dawn, the militarized state in The Crazies and Day, and by a self-cannibalizing, disputatious media culture in Dawn and particularly in Diary.” (LUCKHURST, 2016:156-157)

<h3>LUCKHURST, ZUMBI, </h3>
The perpetual disputes in the last redoubted mark the end of a cohesive public sphere, while engulfment by the zombie amss becomes a dramatization of its mute ad deathly embrace, yet each loophole escape signals the fugitive chances of a counter public sphere, a different way of living” (LUCKHURST, 2016:157)

<h3>LUCKHURST, ZUMBI, VIRUS</h3>
“In 1989,  a World Health Organization conference coined the term ‘emerging infections’ to name potentially catastrophic new global health threats. (LUCKHURST, 2016:179)

<h3>LUCKHURST, ZUMBI, VIRUS</h3>
‘It is perhaps the classic disaster scenario for reflexive modernity - that is, a risk that is created and exemplified by modernity itself, by the interconnectedness of global transport and communication networks. ‘A permanent modern scenario: apocalypse looms… and it doesn’t occur. And it still looms’, Susan Sontag said in her reflections on AIDS and its Metaphors.” (LUCKHURST, 2016:179)

<h3>LUCKHURST, ZUMBI, VIRUS, </h3>
“The zombie really fused with the notion of the virus, though, which was first popularly understood and explained as a distinct entity in the 1950s. They remain an uncanny fit.” (LUCKHURST, 2016:180)

<h3>LUCKHURST, VIRUS, MORTO-VIVO</h3>
“Wendell Stanley, a pioneer Nobel Prize-winning virologist, explained that viruses were ‘entities neither living nor dead, that belong to the twilight zone between the living and the non-living” (LUCKHURST, 2016:180)

<h3>LUCKHURST, ZUMBI, PANDEMIA, VIRUS</h3>
“The paradigmatic scene for the zombie pandemic is a computer map of the globe charting the exponential spread of the disease” (LUCKHURST, 2016:181)

<h3>LUCKHURST, APOCALIPSE, </h3>
“Apocalypse has tome to mean complete catastrophe, but it has also always meant, in the biblical tradition, a revelation, an unveiling of a tremendous Final Truth.” (LUCKHURST, 2016:182)

<h3>LUCKHURST, ZUMBI, PANDEMIA</h3>
“What the zombie outbreak narrative really reveals - as do all epidemics - is the shape of out networks and risky attachments, our sense of an incredibly fragile global ecology. Frank Kermode long ago suggested that disaster narratives served ‘our deep need for intelligible Ends’ while we were stuck in the confusing midsst of things: ‘We project ourselves… past the End, so as to see the structure whole, a thing we can’t do from our own spot of time in the middle.” (LUCKHURST, 2016:183)

<h3>LUCKHURST, ZUMBI, CAPITALISMO, FOUCAULT</h3>
“Perhaps the zombie is less allegoresis - a writing otherwise - than a literalization of the capitalist logic of the expropriation of dead labour from living bodies. ‘Biopower’, the extension of the system’s invasive control into bodies and the processes of life (and death) itself, marks a new stage of capitalist development” (LUCKHURST, 2016:183)

<h3>LUCKHURST, ZUMBI, CAPITALISMO, MBEMBE, NECROPOLÍTICA</h3>
“This new empire of capital comes with a ‘necropolitics’ that Achille Mbembe redards as a renewal of the social death of slavery in neocolonial form” (LUCKHURST, 2016:183)

<h3>LUCKHURST, FICÇÃO CIENTÍFICA, ZUMBI, HORROR</h3>
“It has been suggested that science fiction, fantasy and horror are able to capture these aspects of the ‘world storm’ because they are ‘planetary fictions’, uniquely aware of the imbrication of story and world in a way that more domesticated realism cannot begin to grasp” (LUCKHURST, 2016:184)

<h3>LUCKHURST, MONSTRO, ZUMBI, CAPITALISMO</h3>
“The new monster operates autonomously, in an inhuman way. The medicalization of the zombie outbreak narrative already maps the space of flows in this new kind of informational capitalism, because it points up the permanent condition of teetering on pidemiological catastrophe that modern risk society experiences” (LUCKHURST, 2016:184)

    <h3>LUCKHURST, ZUMBI, METÁFORA</h3>
“The zombie is not simply a metaphor, ultimately reducible to a single explanation. Each instance demands attention and a recognition that itwould not work to condense such complex social realities if it was instantly interpretable” (LUCKHURST, 2016:196)
