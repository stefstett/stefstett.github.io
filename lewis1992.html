<h3>LEWIS, APOCALIPSE</H3>

SouNDiNG like Billy Graham, the ecologist Paul Ehrlich argues in The Population Bomb (1968) that the population explosion will be halted by "three of the four apocalyptic
horsemen - war, pestilence, and famine."2 In a 1970 essay on
threats to the survival of industrial civilization, "Salvation: It's
Possible," the biologist Barry Commoner concludes: "We
must determine now to develop, in the next decade, the new
means of our salvation."3 In a 1975 essay, "There Isn't Much
Time," another biologist, George Wald, admits: "I am one of
those scientists who . . . still finds it difficult to see how the
human race will get itself much past the year 2000. "4 And, finally, the astronomer Carl Sagan warns, in his 1980 book and
television series, Cosmos, that "we may have only a few decades
until Doomsday (LEWIS, 1992, p. 307)

<h3>LEWIS, RETÓRICA APOCALÍPTICA, CIENTISTAS, TRANSFORMAÇÃO</H3>

Without acknowledging their participation in the Christian apocalyptic tradition, these scientists have used the most
resonant terms of apocalyptic rhetoric - salvation, harmony, and
day of judgment, the judgment seat, the horsemen of the apocalypse,
being saved, repentance, atonement and the last days - to call for the
cultural and intellectual transformation of the modern world.
Why have activist scientists since the 1930s increasingly
adopted this apocalyptic rhetoric? (LEWIS, 1992, p. 308)

<h3>LEWIS, APOCALIPSE SECULAR, </H3>

For Barkun, secular apocalypticism is a recent
phenomenon arising out of attempts to make sense of "dangerous but inconclusive political developments and from the
growing willingness to contest the promise of technology."7
Unlike recent religious apocalypticism, he argues, secular apocalypticism is not based upon a cohesive and continuous tradition and argument (LEWIS, 1992, p. 308)

<h3>LEWIS, CRENÇA, MUNDO MODERNO, PROGRESSO, </H3>

In fact, his division
between the secular and the sacred reflects the modern world's
faith that it is rational and scientific, and represents a radical
historical break from humanity's religious and mythological
past. But apocalyptic scientists since the 1930s have warned
that the modern world's faith in endless scientific and technological progress is irrational and could cause the collapse of
modern industrial civilization and the extinction of humanit (LEWIS, 1992, p. 308)

<h3>LEWIS, CRÍTICA CIENTÍFICA DA MODERNIDADE, </H3>

It is impossible to understand the development of this scientific critique of modernity if we continue to insist on separating
the Christian and secular apocalyptic traditions as Barkun does.
What Barkun calls secular apocalypticism, and I call ecological apocalypticism, grew out of the fear of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Christian and cultural critics that human domination ornature would cause the decay and death of the natural
world. Since the sixteenth century, critics of progress and modernity have drawn from both the Christian apocalyptic tradition and contemporary science in shaping their prophetic
warnings of the death of natur (LEWIS, 1992, p. 308-309)

<h3>LEWIS, APOCALIPSE CIENTÍFICO, PROGRESSO</H3>

Such scientific
apocalypticism articulates these scientists' radical fear that scientific and technological progress has created powers that are
beyond human control (LEWIS, 1992, p. 309)

<h3>LEWIS, APOCALIPSE ECOLÓGICO, COLAPSO, CRENÇA, MUNDO MODERNO</H3>

An examination of the historical development
of this ecological apocalyptic discourse since the sixteenth century will demonstrate that this convergence of apocalyptic
scientists, Christian, and cultural critics represents the growing
collapse of faith in progress and the modern world. The death
of nature and the end of modern industrial civilization may be
metaphors describing the imminent collapse of the modern
world view and outlining new structures for organizing human
society and its relationship to the natural world (LEWIS, 1992, p. 309)

<h3>LEWIS, MORTE DA NATUREZA, EXTINÇÃO DA HUMANIDADE</H3>

I use the term ecological apocalyptic to refer to those scientists
and cultural critics who employ the threat of the death of nature or the extinction of humanity to support their calls for the
immediate transformation of science and modern industrial
civilizatio (LEWIS, 1992, p. 309)

<h3>LEWIS, CIÊNCIA, MUNDO MODERNO</H3>

Since the seventeenth century, science has been at the center
of a cultural and political struggle between supporters and critics of the modern world. Writing about this dialectical struggle
between pessimism and optimism since the seventeenth century, David Lowenthal notes that "apocalyptic doom had shaped the scrutiny of the pessimists; faith in progress through
evolving science and technology guided the environmental observations of the optimists."9 In The Death of Nature, Carolyn
Merchant argues that "through dialectical interaction science
and culture develop as an organic whole, fragmenting and reintegrating out of both social and intellectual tensions and tendencies."10 It is because of this dialectical interaction that
Christian apocalyptics use the most current science and apocalyptic ecologists use Christian apocalypticism to frame their critiques of the modern world (LEWIS, 1992, p. 309-310)

<h3>LEWIS, MUNDO MODERNO, DESENVOLVIMENTO, CRESCIMENTO, MORTE DA NATUREZA</H3>

Since the seventeenth century, Christian, Romantic, and scientific critics have worried that the modern world's commitment to endless growth and development will cause the decay
and death of nature. They have feared that the accelerating
transformation of the natural world threatened the human future. The expansion of modern industrial civilization throughout the world has, in fact, caused the increasing destruction of
the global environment (LEWIS, 1992, p. 310)

<h3>LEWIS, MORTE DA NATUREZA</H3>

Pollution, overpopulation, poverty, deforestation, and famine were common problems in medieval Europe and helped reinforce fears of the decay and death of nature.14 The view that
human evil engendered nature's decay permeated late sixteenth- and seventeenth-century European thought.15 Both
the fear of the death of nature and progress grew out of medieval Christian apocalypticism (LEWIS, 1992, p. 310)

<h3>LEWIS, ST. CYPRIAN</H3>

t. In 252 A.D., St. Cyprian in his Epistle to Demetrianus wrote about the disaster overtaking the Roman Empire:
"The decline is universal; the earth is becoming exhausted, the
heavens are losing their powers to influence earthly affairs, the
moral order is being subverte (LEWIS, 1992, p. 311)

<h3>LEWIS, PREOCUPAÇÃO, POLUIÇÃO, GALILEU, COPÉRNICO</H3>

This apocalypticism arose out of concern about pollution
and social and cultural turmoil in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. The discoveries of Galileo and Copernicus, the
apostasy of Luther, and religious and political wars helped generate these apocalyptic fear (LEWIS, 1992, p. 311)

<h3>LEWIS, CORRUPÇÃO HUMANA, MORTE DA NATUREZA</H3>

Deforestation, soil erosion, and the social chaos created
by the Reformation, scientific developments, and political turmoil caused by religious and economic conflicts demonstrated
to Goodman that nature was decaying under humanity's corrupting influence. Goodman and others believed that nature
decayed because man, through arrogance and sin, violated the
balance and harmony of God's work.24 His apocalyptic warning, The Fall of Man, was very popular and influential in early
seventeenth-century Europe (LEWIS, 1992, p. 312)

<h3>LEWIS, DESCARTES, NEWTON</H3>

Carl Becker argues that after
Descartes and Newton, "God's will was revealed in the great
book of nature which men were to study in order to interpret,
and to interpret in order that their ideas and customs might
attain an increasing perfection by being brought into greater
harmony with the laws of nature and of nature's God."27
Newton spent the last years of his life trying to determine when
the apocalypse would occur by looking for portents in natur (LEWIS, 1992, p. 313)

<h3>LEWIS, BACON, DESCARTES, CIÊNCIA MODERNA, RAZÃO, CONQUISTA, DOMÍNIO, NATUREZA</H3>

In the seventeenth century, Francis Bacon and René
Descartes argued that modern science and human reason could
improve the natural world. They believed that modern science
and human understanding of natural law could give humanity
the power to conquer and dominate nature. Improvements in
science, industry, and commerce supported the arguments of
scientists, such as Bacon and Descartes, who rejected the idea
of the impending end of the world caused by human sin and
the decay of natur (LEWIS, 1992, p. 313)

<h3>LEWIS, APOCALIPSE, PROTESTANTISMO, COLONIALISMO, PROGRESSO</H3>

Protestants began to believe that there
would be a millennium before the apocalypse, and that humanity was progressively creating the millennium through its religious and scientific advances. Many Protestants believed that
the Reformation was a sign of the coming millennium. They
also believed that the discovery and settling of America was another sign.30 The Christian apocalypse came to justify the millennial faith in religious and scientific progress.31 Progress
became a cultural myth that reconciled rapid economic development and social change with Anglo-Europeans' understanding of their relationship to God and the natural world (LEWIS, 1992, p. 314)

<h3>LEWIS, MORTE DA NATUREZA</H3>

Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, religious and philosophical critics of progress and the Enlightenment continued to raise fears about the decay and death of
nature.34 In the 1740s, English physico-theological poets, such
as Young and Armstrong, wrote about the Last Days and the
end of the world. These poets imagined the decay and deterioration of the world. Some of them were even referred to as
deteriorationis (LEWIS, 1992, p. 314)

<h3>LEWIS, THE LAST MAN</H3>

Mary Shelley's novel The Last Man (1826) and Thomas
Campbell's poem The Last Man (1823) were two of the most
popular of the numerous last-man stories, poems, and paintings in the early nineteenth century. In Mary Shelley's work,
humanity dies at the hands of a deadly plague. In Thomas
Campbell's, humanity dies because of the aging of the Sun and
Earth and the resulting war, plague, and famine. Edgar Allan
Poe, a contemporary of Shelley, wrote three last-man stories.
In all of them, humanity was struck down by nature just as it
thought it was invincible. In Poe's short story, "The Colloquy
of Monos and Una," the end of the world is caused by the belief in progress and the attempt to control nature rather than
obey natural law.41 In Terminal Visions, Wagar argues that the
central theme of last-man stories is that self-redemption
through progress is impossible and humanity will fall victim to
the awesome powers of natur (LEWIS, 1992, p. 316)

<h3>LEWIS, REVOLUÇÃO INDUSTRIAL</H3>

In his excellent study of apocalyptic fiction
and cultural anxiety, The Pattern of Expectation, 1644-2001
(1979), I. F. Clarke argues that these Romantic prophecies of
the end of the world represent an attempt to restore the "sacred bond between man and nature."48 These stories were trying to make sense of the rapidly changing world at the
beginning of the Industrial Revolution (LEWIS, 1992, p. 317)

<h3>LEWIS, PROGRESSO, APOCALIPSE ECOLÓGICO</H3>

Man and Nature, by the statesman and geographer George
Perkins Marsh (1864), was one of the first and most influential
scientific warnings about progress and the threat of an ecological apocalypse. Having traveled in Europe and Asia and in the
United States, Marsh feared that industrial society was threatening nature by its reckless expansion (LEWIS, 1992, p. 318)

<h3>LEWIS, PROGRESSO, MORTE DA NATUREZA</H3>

From the 1830s to the 1880s, during the height of the hegemony of the idea of progress, cultural anxiety about the
death of nature declined and end-of-the- world stories were relatively rare (LEWIS, 1992, p. 319)

<h3>LEWIS, CONSERVACIONISMO</H3>

From 1850 to 1915, certain California scientists played a major role in the emergence of the conservation movement in the
United States. They helped found the Sierra Club. John
Muir was an earth scientist who had carefully studied Marsh's
Man and Nature, Like Muir, scientists and conservationists in
California in the late nineteenth century were worried about
deforestation and soil erosion. Up until the 1910s, they actively supported conservationism by continually warning of the
danger of the wanton destruction of natural resources. Their
primary concern was industrial expansion's threat to the balance of nature (LEWIS, 1992, p. 319)

<h3>LEWIS, PROFISSIONALIZAÇÃO DA CIÊNCIA, GOVERNO, INDÚSTRIA</H3>

With the growing professionalization of science at the turn of
the century, science became more dependent on governmental
and industrial sources of support. As a result, it became increasingly difficult for scientists to challenge corporate capitalism and the uncontrolled industrial exploitation of the
environment. Thus late nineteenth-century American scientists were defeated in their attempts to maintain a balance between their scientific expertise, their interest in conservation,
and their need for funding and support from industry and government. But they had helped raise concerns about progress
and the destruction of nature in the late nineteenth centur (LEWIS, 1992, p. 320)

<h3>LEWIS, CRISE DE FÉ, PROGRESSO</H3>

Since the 1890s, in both Europe and America, there has been
a crisis of faith in progress. Fears and anxiety about social
revolution, wars, poverty, the domination of corporate capitalism, the destruction of wilderness, and the increasing pace of
change caused many Anglo-Europeans to become disillusioned. Having reached the height of its cultural hegemony in
the 1870s and 1880s, progress has increasingly been challenged since the 1890s. Many cultural critics now believe that
scientific and technological progress would inevitably destroy
humanity, not lead to the "effecting of all things possible."
These critics feared that progress had become a juggernaut humanity could not control (LEWIS, 1992, p. 320)

<h3>LEWIS, REFERÊNCIAS</H3>

In their apocalyptic ecological novels, British nature writers
Richard Jefferies in After London (1885) and W. H. Hudson in A
Crystal Age (1887) prophesied that nature would destroy industrial civilization and a chosen remnant would survive to create a
new world in balance and harmony with nature (LEWIS, 1992, p. 320)

<h3>LEWIS, FICÇÃO CIENTÍFICA</H3>

In the 1880s and 1890s, human-made apocalypses began to
appear in popular speculative fiction, such as John Ames Mitchell's The Last American (1889), Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee
at King Arthur's Court (1892), George Griffith's The Angel of the
Revolution (1893), and Robert Cromie's The Crack of Doom
(1895).(LEWIS, 1992, p. 320-321)

<h3>LEWIS, MORTE DA NATUREZA, ENTROPIA</H3>

Fears about the death of nature and the decay of civilization
were reinforced by the physics of Clausius and Helmholtz and
the idea of entropy in the late nineteenth centur (LEWIS, 1992, p. 321)

<h3>LEWIS, ENTROPIA, CRISE DE FÉ, PROGRESSO</H3>

Adams feared that the theory of entropy had made history a
science of degradation.78 As it did for Adams, entropy caused a
crisis of faith in progress among many intellectual (LEWIS, 1992, p. 321)

<h3>LEWIS, ANSIEDADE, GUERRA, </H3>

Anxiety about war in the early 1900s led to increased anxiety
about progress, but this time focused more directly upon science and technology (LEWIS, 1992, p. 322)

<h3>LEWIS, PRIMEIRA GUERRA MUNDIAL, CIÊNCIA, </H3>

After the brutal savagery of WWI, science became the contested ground upon which Americans tried to mitigate their
fears about progress, social disorder, and the growing instability of the economy and society. The revolt against science in
the 1920s and 1930s was part of a growing challenge by middle-class Americans and Europeans to progress and Western
industrial civilization (LEWIS, 1992, p. 322)

<h3>LEWIS, PROGRESSO</H3>

At the same time, a number of prominent theologians, historians, scientists, and cultural critics of science began to seriously question progress (LEWIS, 1992, p. 323)

<h3>LEWIS, CIÊNCIA, PROGRESSO</H3>

In this context of cultural anxiety and despair about science
and progress, scientists began to reassess their responsibility
for the ills of modern industrial society. Was science responsible for the threats to Western civilization? Concerned British
and American scientists began to argue that science was "frustrated" by its inability to use its knowledge to improve society
and its growing recognition that science was being used for destructive purposes, such as war and the degradation of Earth's
natural resources. In an essay entitled, "Industry and Science," in The Frustration of Science, British scientist J. D. Bernal
wrote: "The present direction of economic and political forces
holds out no hope that physical science can realize its possibilities, or even escape from being used for the destruction of the
world that it helped to create."92 In his book, The Social Functions of Science (1939), Bernal recognized the very real concerns
of the moratorium advocates about the threats science posed to
society.93 British physicist Bernard Lovell wrote in Science and
Civilization (1939): "Are the terrible frustrated powers of science going to strike at the very life-blood of civilization before
it attains a sufficient morality?"94 The growing threat of Fascism in the late 1930s led many American and British scientists
to re-evaluate their belief in social neutrality and their refusal
to be concerned about the social uses of science (LEWIS, 1992, p. 324)

<h3>LEWIS, CIÊNCIA, RETÓRICA APOCALÍPTICA, PROGRESSO REGULADO PELA CIÊNCIA</H3>

In the
late 1930s, in fact, many scientists and their scientific organizations adopted the apocalyptic rhetoric of moratorium advocates. These scientists warned that unless scientists played a
larger role in social planning, Western industrial civilization could destroy itself. They believed that progress must be controlled and regulated by science (LEWIS, 1992, p. 324-235)

<h3>LEWIS, SEGUNDA GUERRA MUNDIAL, ANSIEDADE, CIENTISTAS</H3>

World War II only heightened this anxiety among scientists
about humanity's ability to control its increasingly global industrial civilization. With the explosion of the atomic bombs
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, some atomic scientists feared that
science had "sinned," that science had given humanity the
power to destroy the world. Robert Oppenheimer's stunned
apocalyptic reaction to the first atomic bomb explosion expressed this radical fear: "I have become Death, the shatterer
of Worlds."95 An agonized Oppenheimer told President Truman: "I feel we have blood on our hands."96 Concerned about
the threat of nuclear war, physicist Leo Szilard lobbied for
world government, arguing that "permanent peace cannot be
established without a world government."97 Many atomic
scientists experienced this radical apocalyptic fear and came to
the realization that if science didn't control the future development of the atom, then humanity could destroy itsel (LEWIS, 1992, p. 325)

<h3>LEWIS, PROGRESSO, PESADELO</H3>

For many apocalyptic scientists, progress has become a
nightmare. In a chapter entitled "To Survive on Earth," in his
book Science and Survival (1965), Barry Commoner wrote: "The
obligation which our technological society forces upon all of
us, scientist and citizen alike, is to discover how humanity can
survive the new power which science has given it (LEWIS, 1992, p. 326)

<h3>LEWIS, AUTORIDADE, CIÊNCIA, PROGRESSO</H3>

Using the authority of science, apocalyptic critics of
progress have attracted a growing world-wide following. Apocalyptic scientists have caused many Americans and Europeans
to lose their faith in progress. Scientific prophecies of ecological collapse have led many to question the modern world view (LEWIS, 1992, p. 326)

<h3>LEWIS, CRISE</H3>

Apocalyptic scientists challenge modern science to help
transform the modern world or accept the imminent collapse of
modern industrial civilization. By insisting on the contradiction between an ecological understanding of the modern world
and uncontrolled progress, they have helped create a cultural
crisis similar to the crisis that gave birth to the modern world
during the Renaissance and Reformatio (LEWIS, 1992, p. 326)

<h3>LEWIS, SAGAN, COSMOS, TERRA</H3>

Fearing this "Doomsday," Carl Sagan concludes Cosmos by arguing that humanity can survive if it realizes that it
speaks for Earth and is "the local embodiment of a Cosmos
grown to self-awareness (LEWIS, 1992, p. 327)

<h3>LEWIS, SÍNTESE, CIÊNCIA MODERNA, RELIGIÃO</H3>

When apocalyptic scientists argue that human survival depends upon "a new . . . synthesis between the modern scientific
understanding and the essence of religious or esoteric traditions," they challenge the modern division between science
and religion (LEWIS, 1992, p. 327)

<h3>LEWIS, SÍNTESE, PROGRESSO, APOCALIPSE</H3>

Since the 1970s, scientists, theologians, and cultural critics
have tried to create a new synthesis between modern science
and religion, which would be the foundation for a new faith and
new world view for a post-modern world. Robert Ornstein and
Paul Ehrlich's New World New Mind (1989), Thomas Berry's The
Dream of the Earth (1988), Wes Jackson's Altars of Unhewn Stone (1987), and David Ehrenfelďs The Arrogance ofHumanism (1981)
are excellent examples of this attempt to imagine a post-modern world, a world beyond progress and apocalypse (LEWIS, 1992, p. 327-328)
