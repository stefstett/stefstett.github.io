<h3>HARDING, </h3>

In many cases, of course, the invocation of “objectivity”
for a knowledge claim has more to do with attempts
to boost the status of the claim than with any actual criteria
the claim has satisfied, as philosopher Ian Hacking
(forthcoming) points out. (HARDING, 2015, p. ix)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Continued concern with the term “objectivity” and
what it could stand for testifies to the fact that objectivity
is good to think with, to borrow a phrase from anthropology (HARDING, 2015, p. x)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The term is primarily a modern Western one, and its use
is relatively recent. Galileo and Newton were practicing “natural philosophy,”
in the eyes of their peers. The term “scientist” only began to
appear in the mid-Â nineteenth century, with William Whewell’s (1840)
usage. (HARDING, 2015, p. xi)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

There are “civic science” and “citizen science” in both
social and natural sciences. Participatory action research in the social sciences
had already emerged by the middle of the twentieth century. Radical
forms of collaborative science have taken hold recently in research
with indigenous communities. (HARDING, 2015, p. xi)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The question of how to do research that serves pro-Â democratic ends
directs attention to methodological issues. Alan Megill (1992) pointed
out that those who were concerned with advancing objectivity tended to
focus on one or another of four different components of research (HARDING, 2015, p. xii)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

These
communities must have certain ideals, standards, and practices in order
to do the necessary hard critical engagement with each other’s work,
and yet they must also stay committed to tedious and difficult research
processes over long periods of time and often under extremely adverse
conditions. (HARDING, 2015, p.  xii)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Finally, it is method and methodology upon
which practicing scientists focus their concerns to “operationalize” the
demand to maximize their objectivity. And that will be my primary focus
here. (HARDING, 2015, p. xii)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Standpoint methodology and its “strong objectivity” standard have
become one of the most widely used approaches for research in such
social movements (chapter 2). The immense influence of standpoint approaches
has been primarily due to their ability to turn an epistemic and
political agenda into an easily understandable research methodology (HARDING, 2015, p. xii)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

But how can the culture-Â wide influence of such power and
knowledge positions be countered? Start thinking about research on nature
and social relations from the standpoint of the everyday lives of
an oppressed group, say the social justice movements (Harding 2004) (HARDING, 2015, p.  xii)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

One is to
consider some particularly surprising cases of how social values and interests
have shaped science. (HARDING, 2015, p. xiii)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Understandings of science and its philosophies
in the world of the mid-Â twentieth century turn out to be no longer
entirely appropriate tor helpful in the very different world of today (HARDING, 2015, p. xiii)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Central assumptions of the philosophy of science that
most of us learned in graduate schools in the United States
were grounded in the modernization theory of the late
nineteenth century. This philosophy was reshaped into its
late twentieth century form with the revival of this theory
at the end of World War II. This was the era of the
founding of the United Nations and its development agencies
which were to bring modernization to Third World
countries, and of the start of the Cold War. Western leaders
conceptualized scientific rationality and technical expertise
as the “motors” of development policies and their
modernizing practices. Without their dissemination, modernization
could not occur. (HARDING, 2015, p. 01)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Value-Â free objectivity, rationality, and
good research method were three such central ideals. (HARDING, 2015, p. 01)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

That philosophy of science, referred to as logical empiricism or logical
positivism, is still the dominant one today. It is invoked not only
in philosophy departments but also in the natural and social sciences. (HARDING, 2015, p. 02)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Sciences and their philosophies have never been value-free. (HARDING, 2015, p. 02)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

But they do want a say in transforming the conventional philosophy
of science and its blind allegiance to elite social projects into philosophies
that actually serve their interests and desires for social progress.
They want a kind of epistemic modernization, as sociologist David Hess
(2007) has put the point, that conventional modernization theory and its
philosophy of science have not had the resources to deliver. (HARDING, 2015, p. 04)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The subsequent development
of this work seems to have occasioned scattered rebukes and
occasional slight outreaches, but little sustained engagement from mainstream
philosophers. By the 1970s, feminist approaches to the social
studies of science and technology began to emerge, and then postcolonial
studies began to take on science and technology issues in the 1980s,
though each of these latter two schools of science studies had older roots (HARDING, 2015, p. 05)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Standards for
objectivity, rationality, and good method are often the targets of their
critical accounts. In light of these accounts of how sciences and their
social contexts shape each other, must our philosophies abandon regulatory
ideals of scientific research such as objectivity, rationality, and
uniquely good method? Or can there still be an important role for such
standards in these new relations between sciences, their philosophies,
and their social orders? (HARDING, 2015, p. 05)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The newly organizing development agencies in the United Nations and
in many Western countries would transfer Western scientific rationality
and technical expertise to the “underdeveloped” societies around
the globe. (HARDING, 2015, p. 06)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The “autonomy of science” arguments were propaganda to protect
fledgling scientific institutions from the congressional and other political
interference they expected. To be sure, research in the United States
was more protected from electoral politics than were science projects in
many other countries. (HARDING, 2015, p. 08)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Moreover, didn’t modern Western science also have some degree
of responsibility for the effective gas chambers, efficiently running
trains, and talented munitions industries through which the holocaust
was enacted? (HARDING, 2015, p. 09)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Was the value-Â free
autonomy-Â of-Â science stance taken by leaders of the scientific community
simply an attempt to distract attention from the actual workings of modern
Western science and technology institutions, and to encourage the
scientists, Congress, and the public to be as ignorant as possible about
such workings? (HARDING, 2015, p. 09)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Corporations developing weapons for use
by the US military in Vietnam, such as the napalm sprayed from planes
that scalded civilian men, women, and children, also promised “better
things for better living” through chemistry. And hugely profitable agricultural
corporations promoted a “green revolution” in which their patented
seeds, expensive fertilizers, and toxic pesticides supposedly would
eliminate hunger (Sachs 1992). Intentionally or not, the philosophers
were complicitous in creating an exceptionalist philosophy that positioned
Western science as uniquely capable of advancing human progress. (HARDING, 2015, p. 10)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Feminist epistemology and philosophy of science raised issues alongside
and within the emerging criticisms of the sexism and androcentrism
in the natural and social sciences. These issues quickly became influential
in research disciplines outside philosophy, for they provided compelling
arguments on behalf of the legitimacy and value of the new women’s
studies research in such disciplines (Richardson 2010). They also contributed
to the anti-Â authoritarian changes already underway in academia
more generally, thanks to the social movements of the 1960s. (HARDING, 2015, p. 13)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Hess here refers to the way in which the sixteenth-Â  and seventeenth-Â 
century European “voyages of discovery,” followed by the colonialism
and imperialism of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, incorporated
into European scientific and technical research information, methods,
and materials developed in non-Â European societies.7 Hess draws
here on the Marxian notion of primitive capital accumulation through
which communally shared peasant labor and lands in Europe were appropriated
by members of the emerging capitalist class and their private
industries to enable the production of profit for factory and farm owners.
The owners could reap profits by selling the fruits of the former
peasants’ land and of the workers’ labor for much more than they paid
for the labor of workers and for raw materials.8 But it was not just labor
and land rights that this early capitalist class gathered into its production
processes, Hess is arguing. Even earlier, the European expansion
that began in the 1500s and continued through the Industrial Revolution
created epistemic primitive accumulation. Indigenous astronomy, mapping,
agriculture, botany, and many other kinds of knowledge were appropriated
directly into modern Western sciences during those periods. (HARDING, 2015, p. 15)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

International research is conducted by global networks of laboratories,
universities, research stations, journals, publishers, and more. No longer
is modern Western science done solely by Western elites.10 This is a
way of thinking about “big science” that goes beyond the long lists of
coauthors that sometimes appear on articles in scientific journals. The
researchers in lab coats are not the only ones who produce scientific
knowledge; they constitute only a small proportion of the workforce
necessary to produce each fact (HARDING, 2015, p. 16)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Philosopher Alison Wylie (2004) has documented
this phenomenon among women archeologists. Donna Haraway
(1989) and Sharon Traweek (1988) have done the same with respect to
primatology and high-Â energy physics respectively (HARDING, 2015, p. 16)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Preceding sections of this chapter have drawn attention to ways in which
scientific research and its philosophy were shaped by several powerful
forces in the aftermath of World War II, and ways in which critical scrutiny
of scientific institutions, their practices, and their philosophies have
developed both “from above” and “from below” since about 1970 (HARDING, 2015, p. 18)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Two related fields or
subfields are postcolonial and feminist science and technology studies.
All three of these research fields treat science as a social institution
with features much like those of any other institution (HARDING, 2015, p. 18)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

One of the most fruitful insights of these science studies is that sciences
and their societies co-Â produce and co-Â constitute each other (HARDING, 2015, p. 18)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

They tend to produce such knowledge in the ways that
they produce everything else. In turn, sciences share their societies’ fundamental
assumptions about what is interesting and important to know.
Thus racist, sexist, and imperial societies will tend to sponsor sciences
that, in turn, provide resources for racist, sexist, and imperial societies. (HARDING, 2015, p. 19)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Moreover, gender is not just another word for “women,” as attempts
to “mainstream gender” in international agencies often assume.
Gender is a social relation between men and women, between their stereotypical
characteristics, and between their assigned structural positions
in gender, race, class, and other relevant social hierarchies. Thus it
is important also to examine the masculinity of scientific discourses—Â for
example, in their typical appeals to the heroic and self-Â sacrificing discoveries
of explorers or of Christian aristocrats (see, for example Terrall
1998; Harrison 2005). This is not the place to provide a literature review
of this field. (HARDING, 2015, p. 20)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Richardson counters that in
fact, feminist philosophy of science understands sciences and their philosophies
as “value-Â rich,” and that its great strength is in developing robust
and dynamic philosophical frameworks for modeling social values
in scientific research. Arguably even worse than mainstream philosophy
of science in terms of marginalizing feminist work is mainstream epistemology,
as philosopher Phyllis Rooney argues (2007; 2012). Rooney
provides a thorough account of a broad variety of feminist epistemological
work over the last three decades, and shows just what is wrong with
the criticisms and dismissals it has received in the field.18 (HARDING, 2015, p. 21)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Research to resource
Northern militaries and to expand Northern-Â controlled market projects
tend not to be priorities in these decolonizing countries! (HARDING, 2015, p. 21)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Seth emphasizes that modern Western sciences have from their
origins been constituted in colonial contexts which leave their systematic
marks on the sciences we have today. Yet the violence of colonialism in
“the childhood of science” is now hidden from view through the presentation
of a thoroughly depoliticized history of modern Western sciences (HARDING, 2015, p. 22)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The
problem was that “good science” lacked the methodological
resources to detect widely held sexist and androcentric
assumptions and practices that had shaped these results
of research. (HARDING, 2015, p. 26)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

In contrast, feminist
researchers in the natural sciences and most who worked in the social
sciences wanted stronger, more competent standards for objectivity,
whether quantitative or qualitative research was at issue. They wanted
clarity about the nature of women’s reproductive systems and of women’s
reasoning powers, about the causes of women’s impoverishment
and exclusion from economic and political decision-Â making, and about
the illegitimacy of sexual assaults and domestic battery. Cultural relativist
arguments, frequently used in anthropology, for example, were not
acceptable in these contexts, they insisted. (HARDING, 2015, p. 27)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

For example, the everyday activities of
“woman the gatherer” turned out to be the main source of economic
resources for everyone. The daily fare of hunter-Â gatherer societies consisted
primarily of seeds, berries, greens, roots, and the small mammals
and birds caught by women. The economic contributions of “man the
hunter” were relatively infrequent treats, it turned out; not the day-Â in,
day-Â out source of sustenance anthropologists had claimed. Women, not
men,were the main “breadwinners.” (HARDING, 2015, p. 28)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Political theory assumed that “the political” was only what men engaged
with in statehouses, courthouses, and diplomatic circles. Yet gender
relations in households and workplaces were also fully structured
by relations of power and authority, the critics pointed out. Moreover,
women’s voting patterns did not necessarily simply follow those of their
husbands or fathers, as had been assumed. Women and men had different
interests in households. Benefits to households or to “heads of households”
were not distributed equitably within those households (HARDING, 2015, p. 28)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

In epistemology, philosophy of science, sociology of knowledge, and
political theory, “standpoint theories” began to emerge from this new
women’s movement research.5 Taking inspiration from the Marxian
“standpoint of the proletariat,” these theorists argued that in societies
structured by inequality, the prevailing knowledge and belief tended primarily
to represent the interests of the dominant groups. Yet these groups
were made up almost entirely of men. Women had been excluded from
full participation—Â or even any participation—Â in such groups. Thus the
dominant conceptual frameworks of the disciplines were by no means
value-Â free. They were instead frameworks that responded to the interests
of dominant group men. (HARDING, 2015, p. 29)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

As indicated,
it starts with clear recognition of how science is actually practiced
in the real world today. It does not start from an abstract ideal of what
would make perfect science. Moreover, in light of this situation, it tries
to identify the exact site of the main problem with conventional practices
for achieving value-Â free research: the homogeneity of research communities,
which is both “natural” (for example, only men) and trained
(through disciplinary instruction) (HARDING, 2015, p. 30)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Furthermore, the
strong objectivity proposal is focused on answering questions about the
relation between the conditions of the subjects’ lives and the larger social
relations that shape those conditions. Additionally, it identifies in existing
achievements in women’s movement research just what the researchers
did to achieve such successes, and recommends how to replicate such
achievements in future research (HARDING, 2015, p. 30)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

First, it is important to recognize
that there is no single, fixed meaning of the term “objectivity.” (HARDING, 2015, p. 31)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

In actual research contexts, the term is often used to refer to research
methods. By this is usually meant data collection techniques such as observation,
interviews, surveys, archival research, or statistical strategies.
But in the account here, it is methodology, or theory of method, that is
the concern. The question is how to go about doing research that simultaneously
advances the comprehensiveness and reliability of its results
and also produces resources for answering the kinds of questions that
are most important to an oppressed group.8 In the writings of the standpoint
theorists, these methodology issues are often referred to as “methods”
of research, but it is always clear that it is not the techniques of data
collection but rather the shape and purpose of the research project that
are at issue.9 (HARDING, 2015, p. 33)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

We can extract at least a shared core of commitment in these
multiple meanings and referents. Objective research should be fair to
the evidence, fair to one’s critics, and fair to the most severe criticisms
one can imagine even if no one has yet articulated them. Of course this
is the core of the conventional ideal of objective research. Thus, “strong
objectivity” is faithful to the central commitments of the standard view
in spite of its rejection of the value-Â free ideal (HARDING, 2015, p. 33)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Good
methods are supposed to be able to identify social values, interests, and
assumptions that researchers bring to the research process. (And they
are supposed to be able to eliminate them, as we will shortly discuss.)
If a different researcher or research team repeats the procedures first
used to support a claim, the same results are supposed to be found.
Such a practice confirms the reliability and validity of the procedures (HARDING, 2015, p. 33)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The strong
objectivity program argues that starting research from “outside” a discipline
can enable the detection of the dominant values, interests, and
assumptions that may or may not be widely prevalent, but which tend
to serve primarily the most powerful social groups. “Dominant” can be
used in a geographical sense to mean “most widely used,” and that may
be the sense in which some people think of modern Western science as
“universally valid.” (Though scientists will mean by the latter term that,
for example, the laws of physics hold everywhere in the world, not just
for the interactions with nature of this or that culture.)(HARDING, 2015, p. 34)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

So the strong objectivity
project problemÂ atizes the uncritical recommendation of mere diversity
of human bodies—Â mere multiculturalism—Â in scientific communities.
That is a widely held liberal position that fails to recognize just what is so
scientifically and politically valuable about thinking from the lives of oppressed
groups. Mere diversity doesn’t have the theoretical and analytic
resources to capture what is so valuable about “missing perspectives.”11 (HARDING, 2015, p. 35)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Strong objectivity also demands
interrogation of just which cultural commitments can advance growth
of the kinds of knowledge a particular community desires. Weak objectivity
has been too narrowly focused to detect the values and interests
that most powerfully shape research. Yet in another respect it has been
too broadly focused to maximize objectivity. It demanded that all social
values and interests originating outside research processes be eliminated
from them. Yet in our real world, it cannot be that all useful knowledge
that social communities might want can be produced by sciences
funded primarily by profit-Â making corporations, militaries, and imperial
governments. (HARDING, 2015, p. 35)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Societies with different values and interests have in the past, do now,
and will continue to produce reliable knowledge claims that conflict with
other claims emerging from dominant Western interests and values. Particular
kinds of societies are co-Â produced with the particular kinds of sciences
they want: each enables and limits the other. This insight emerged
from all the antiauthoritarian social movements of the 1960s and from
newly decolonized states. It has subsequently been articulated by the
field of science studies, to which we will shortly turn. The values and interests
of antiauthoritarian, pro-Â democratic social movements appear to
be promising candidates for research communities to call upon in order
to increase the comprehensiveness and reliability of research results. (HARDING, 2015, p. 37)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

I am arguing that standpoint methodology
in fact proposes another, different, reasonable procedure for conducting
scientific research. Starting off research from the questions that arise in
the lives of groups that are excluded from participating significantly in
the design and management of our social institutions and practices permits
us to recognize new and valuable—Â often to us privileged groups
also—Â questions and procedures for answering them that did not, and
perhaps could not, occur to people from the groups who did design and
manage our social worlds. (HARDING, 2015, p. 38)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Consequently, standpoint
methodology can take different forms in different research contexts as
it engages with particular disciplinary histories of theory and practice
focused on relations between experience and knowledge, society, and  science (HARDING, 2015, p. 38-39)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

In the United States and Western Europe, both standpoint methodology’s
fans and its critics have sometimes tried to fit it into methodological
practices and epistemological positions already familiar to them.
This tendency frequently misreads both the strengths and limitations
of this approach. (HARDING, 2015, p. 40)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Does the strong objectivity program introduce politics into otherwise
value-Â neutral sciences? (HARDING, 2015, p. 40)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Note that it is always
some particular subgroup of an oppressed group from which researchers
are to start off their projects—Â for example, mothers incarcerated in
federal prisons in the United States, or women graduate students at tier
1 universities in the United States. Assumptions about what this particular
subgroup of women shares may be warranted or not. Obviously
attention to economic, political, social, cultural, and other differences
between women, their values, experiences, and identities, is crucial for
the reliability of research results.
Another misunderstanding here (HARDING, 2015, p. 41)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Yet another misunderstanding is to think that only those who are
themselves members of a particular oppressed group can develop and use
a research or policy standpoint that comes from that group. For example,
only Latinas, or Muslim women, can develop research projects that
start off from the everyday lives of people in those particular groups. Yet
Latinas differ from each other in class, ethnicity, sexuality, nationality
and other ways—Â and so, too, do Muslim women. (HARDING, 2015, p. 41)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Can strong objectivity be relevant to the natural sciences? Don’t they
already have adequate safeguards against social biases? Such critics presume
that social and cultural elements of research are always eventually
winnowed out, leaving the resounding successes of physics, chemistry,
and biology as “pure science” or “basic research.” (HARDING, 2015, p. 42)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

However, studies by sociologists,
historians, and ethnographers of how research is organized and
how its results are produced in biology, medicine, environmental studies,
engineering, and even physics and chemistry have shown how these
processes, too, are co-Â constituted with their social orders and will share
distinctive social features with them. (HARDING, 2015, p. 42)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

It does not give up Enlightenment, positivist, and logical empiricist
concerns that research should be fair to the empirical evidence, to
its strongest critics, and to the highest ethical principles and the goals of
social justice, as indicated earlier. Of course what counts as fair in each
of these cases has differed from generation to generation, and from culture
to culture. Standpoint projects importantly advance Enlightenment
goals as these make sense for our world today (HARDING, 2015, p. 43)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Does strong objectivity abandon the importance of truth, value-Â freedom,
and universally valid claims and practices about nature and social relations?
In my opinion, there are two acceptable ways to answer this
question. One is to argue, as I have argued above, that strong objectivity
standards simply recognize realities about nature and social research
practice that could not be detected in earlier eras. For example, there
is no “view from nowhere” position that ever could exist from which
one can see every social and natural reality in the past, present, and future.(HARDING, 2015, p. 43)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Strong objectivity is not committed to all knowledge claims
being equally valid; it is not committed to “anything goes,” as Paul Feyerabend
(1975) put the methodological point. It is committed rather to
“situated knowledge,” in Donna Haraway’s (1988) words (HARDING, 2015, p. 44)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Indeed, it is clear that there are a number of other distinctive cultural
assumptions that shape much Western feminist work. For example, few
feminists have critically examined the distinctively Christian and Protestant
religious and spiritual commitments that have been identified as
being embedded in a Western secularism which is also a foundational
commitment of Western sciences and their philosophies and methodologies,
including feminist varieties. (HARDING, 2015, p. 45)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The recent studies of “sciences
from below” that use a standpoint methodology, whether or not it
is so named, can seem to have little in common with the laboratory studies
that were so innovative in the first generation of sociologies, histories,
and ethnographies of the natural sciences. (HARDING, 2015, p. 46)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

One such alignment can be found
in the evidence that objectivity ideals and the favored strategies for
achieving them have social histories; that is, they change in response
to shifts in scientific methods and goals, as well as from processes in
and pressures from society (HARDING, 2015, p. 46)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Sheila Jasanoff (2004, 2005) demonstrated how different
national anxieties and political cultures required different strategies to
secure the objectivity of biotechnology decisions in Germany, England,
and the United States (HARDING, 2015, p. 47)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Such sciences might be autonomous from
their societies in the sense that no economic, political, or social authority
was explicitly directing their agendas. Yet this kind of autonomy has
gotten scarcer in recent decades, as research has become more expensive
and as information has increasingly become the most important
“capital” of the global political economy. But even with this kind of
autonomy, sciences have still shared with their societies values, interests,
and, one could say, foci of curiosity that were distinctive of the era. (HARDING, 2015, p. 48)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Moreover, such sciences would tend to provide further resources
for the dominant groups in such societies. They insisted that it would
take changes in these unjust social orders to legitimate sciences that were
more accurate and that better aligned with democratic social relations,
and that such sciences would in turn help to transform such societies (HARDING, 2015, p. 48)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Wouldn’t
the producers and users of indigenous knowledge qualify here, as will
be addressed in a later chapter? Wouldn’t women’s knowledge of our
bodies, of the needs of our dependents, of the local environments with
which we interact in the work we do also qualify? (HARDING, 2015, p. 49)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

A related focus in science studies has been on
how Western philosophy of science has tended to overvalue representing
nature’s order at the cost of an adequate appreciation of the importance
of scientific intervention in it. (HARDING, 2015, p. 49)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Recently a few philosophers of
science have started from the lives of indigenous knowers to identify the
practices that have so powerfully advanced their knowledge systems.30
Again, this work uses the standpoint methodology, without so naming
it, to achieve greater fairness to available evidence of non-Â Western cultures’
knowledge systems. (HARDING, 2015, p. 50)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

What kinds of sciences do we want for today’s multicultural, democratic
societies? What kind do we want for a West that is already encountering
repeated “decentering” in today’s global political economy? These
are not the issues faced by the influential philosophers of science of one
and two generations ago. Yet many of us share with these intellectual
and political legacies commitments to developing more fair and socially
responsible societies and the kinds of sciences that can serve such goals. (HARDING, 2015, p. 50)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

This chapter will consider just one of the many foci
of feminist research: namely women, gender, and Third
World development, or development in the Global South,
as it will sometimes be referred to here. (HARDING, 2015, p. 52)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Philosophy
of the natural sciences is relevant in another way also, since the standards
for maximizing objectivity in those fields have been so influential
in the social sciences. Even qualitative research has to justify the empirical
reliability of its research results under the shadow of the standards
for quantitative research that were initiated in the natural sciences. In
other words, social science research has had to justify the theoretical
adequacy and predictive power of its results either by using quantitative
methods or by developing arguments for the necessarily different standards
of adequacy for qualitative methods. (HARDING, 2015, p. 53)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Yet the last
five decades of social studies of science and technology have revealed the
impossibility of isolating sciences from their social milieu. Sciences and
their societies co-Â produce and co-Â constitute each other, sociologists and
historians have argued, as has been pointed out in chapter 1. Even such
apparently value-Â free practices as statistics have been conceptualized
and organized around two quite different kinds of social projects that
serve different class interests (Porter 1995). (HARDING, 2015, p. 53)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

How should one refer to the typically invoked contrasts between
the large regions of the globe that are the object of the discussion in this
chapter? Five different binaries have been favored in such contrasts.3
The opening of this chapter referred to First World versus the Third
World, and to the Global North versus the Global South. Also used are
the binaries West versus non-Â West (or Orient), developed versus undeveloped
(or developing), and industrialized versus nonindustrialized.
One might think it preferable to settle on just one of these terminologies
and use it consistently. However, each of these binaries has its own
particular history and politics. Each is either meaningless or confusing
when used in other contexts.(HARDING, 2015, p. 54)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The term “Global South” was invented by activists from that area
at the 1992 United Nations environment conference in Rio de Janeiro.
However, it seems to fit all too well with those discussions of globalization
that want to hide histories of colonialism and North-Â controlled
development policies. It can be difficult to get the relevance of such
histories recognized in discussions of globalization. Moreover, this
binary can seem purely descriptive, though it isn’t. Are Japan, Australia,
Native America, or Mexico in the Global North or South? It
also seems to lack any relevant social or geographical reference when
used in the context of the two earlier periods (HARDING, 2015, p. 54)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Yet women have been presumed
to be less capable of human rationality in general, and certainly
of scientific rationality. And women’s distinctive technical expertises in
child care, household, and agricultural contexts, for example, have been
excluded from what counts as real technical expertise. Indeed, it seems
reasonable to assume that women cannot become modern, as a number
of scholars have argued. Modernity has again and again positioned itself
against the traditional, the private sphere, and the feminine (Felski
1995; Harding 2008) (HARDING, 2015, p. 55)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Of course such neglect greatly damages women’s lives. But I am here
also arguing something more provocative: that such neglect renders impossible
the achievement of the stated development goal of eradicating
poverty, (HARDING, 2015, p. 56)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Rather, women and
their dependents are the vast majority of the poor around the globe, including
in the industrialized North, and they are highly overrepresented
in whatever measure one uses of the poorest of the poor. Again and
again their further impoverishment seems to have been required for development
projects to be regarded as “successful.” (HARDING, 2015, p. 56)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

This brings into sharp focus the limitations
of conventional standards for maximizing objectivity with respect to
women and gender issues. Moreover, it does so with respect mainly to
social sciences: economics, political science, sociology. Natural science
issues also appear when the focus is on health, reproduction, environmental,
or technology issues. (HARDING, 2015, p. 57)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Here one can see that these debates about women, gender,
development, and objectivity have global dimensions; they have implications
for policies of such institutions as the World Bank, the United
Nations, and any other that claims to advance social progress for all
without specifically attending to women’s distinctive needs and desires (HARDING, 2015, p. 57)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Additionally, these debates draw attention to the fact that the category
“women” is not a homogenous one, any more than are the categories
“men,” “humans,” “citizens,” or “poor persons.” Women occupy
distinctive locations in hierarchies of class, race, ethnicity, and sexuality,
in histories of colonial relations, and in forms of modernization (HARDING, 2015, p. 57)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

By any measure, the vast majority of the poor are
women and their dependents, though it is difficult to find acknowledgment
of this fact in mainstream development literature. How does this
come about? The virtually universal assignment of family and household
responsibilities to women limits the time and energy that they have
for wage work. The occupations available to them tend to be those with
lower wages. When they work in jobs primarily held by men, they tend
to be paid less than men. In two-Â parent families, women rarely have
equal control of the distribution of household income. Widespread domestic
and public violence against women limits their abilities to access
and control the resources, such as education and wage work, that are
needed by them and their dependents. Increasingly large percentages of
women in every society tend to be heads of households, and thus they
must provision their dependents as well as themselves with the meager
resources available to them (HARDING, 2015, p. 59)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Anti-Â poverty programs tend to set and
reset the “poverty line” in ways that increase their chances of being able
to provide evidence of success, even though this is always at the expense
of the poorest of the poor (HARDING, 2015, p. 60)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Successfully addressing women’s
poverty requires strategies different from those that most benefit men.
It is one thing to recognize the gender inequality in the distribution of
poverty. However, mainstream approaches have tended to avoid treating
women’s needs and desires as revealing sources of information about
how to reduce poverty. Rather, they tend to draw on false gender stereotypes
in their strategies. One such assumption has been that men are
the breadwinners in households. Another has been that households are
internally homogenous: everyone benefits equally from any resources
received by the head of the household. These assumptions are as false
in the developing world as they are in industrialized countries (HARDING, 2015, p. 60)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Another facet of this issue is that all
too often, equality has been presumed to mean sameness. It has taken
huge struggles in the United States to secure recognition that equality
must require attention to the particular conditions and needs of women,
as to those of any other group. Sometimes sameness will be an appropriate
way to conceptualize equality; in many other contexts it will not.
One of the most important achievements in making legal recognition of
equality require attention to “difference” was the success of the “equal
rights for equal worth” struggle (HARDING, 2015, p. 61)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

From the beginning, feminist voices have argued
against the classical assumption of modernization theory that it
is the expansion of capitalist economic relations that most importantly
eliminates poverty and advances social welfare. Feminists insisted that
development must also include social, political, ethical, aesthetic, and
environmental development (e.g., Braidotti et al. 1994). Critics of the
development policies of institutions such as the World Bank, coming
from many different social justice movements, have mounted similar
criticisms (HARDING, 2015, p. 61)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The population experts had argued that poor women’s ignorant and
irresponsible reproductive behaviors were causing such poverty and environmental
destruction in India, China, and other parts of the world.
The solution was to teach poor women modern birth control practices,
to institute policies such as China’s one-Â child policy with its accompanying
punishments for disobedience, and to enforce poor women’s sterilization
where possible. That is, women’s sexuality was regarded as being
responsible for overpopulation and the destruction of environments.
Poor women were assumed to be ignorant of birth control strategies.
Women’s reproductive behavior was regarded as irrational since it supposedly
caused extreme poverty, as well as irreversible environmental
destruction, as more and more natural resources were needed to feed,
house, and clothe increasing numbers of poor people (HARDING, 2015, p. 62)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

In modernization and development theory, the model of the worker is
of an adult male industrial laborer working for wages outside his household,
in a permanent, year-Â round, full-Â time job with no children present.
Feminist analysts have insisted that this androcentric model obscures
the majority of women’s work and the huge proportion of human labor
which women do (HARDING, 2015, p. 63)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

It is clear that as women in the Global North have worked more outside
the household and in jobs previously reserved for men, the North
has had to outsource to other groups of women the care work that these
women had performed in the household and in conventional women’s
jobs. Since the North has a care deficit, often these are women from
the Global South. Thus, for example, child care workers, housecleaners,
nurses, eldercare workers, waiters, and restaurant staff in the United
States and Europe are often mostly women from the Global South. Of
course the absence of these women from their own families and communities
in their countries of origin creates care deficits in the societies they
have left. So yet other women in those societies often must add to their
own workloads care for the children and sick and elderly kin of international
care workers. These are often the children’s grandmothers, aunts,
or neighbors. Chains of women’s care—Â “care chains”—Â stretching across
the globe must be created to satisfy the Global North’s care deficit (HARDING, 2015, p. 65)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Indigenous
knowledge would seem to meet the basic requirements
of the updated objectivity ideal presented in chapterÂ€
2. Mostly it produces reliable knowledge claims and is
fair to the data it encounters and to critical perspectives
on it—Â for example, by modern Western scientists and
philosophers as well as by members of its own culture and
of others. Yet educated Westerners only rarely regard it as
satisfying the requirements of “real science.” (HARDING, 2015, p. 80)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Writing in what was still the heyday of European colonialism, Malinowski
questioned the sharp line that peoples of European descent
typically drew between the exceptionalist and triumphalist image they
maintained toward their own attempts to understand nature and the
backwardness and primitiveness they attributed to such attempts by
the peoples they encountered in their far-Â flung colonies and empires (HARDING, 2015, p. 81)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Yet far too
many educated Westerners still tend to assume that the differences between
modern Western sciences and other cultures’ indigenous knowledge
systems are so great and so significant that it is not reasonable to
consider the latter in the category of sciences. They disagree with Kwasi
Wiredu’s assertion that non-Â Western societies practice rational, objective
investigation. (HARDING, 2015, p. 81)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

To be sure, the term “science” is not what indigenous cultures use to
refer to their knowledge systems. Indeed, Galileo, Newton, and Boyle
were “natural philosophers” to their contemporaries and to later generations.
It was not until the early nineteenth century that the term “science”
was introduced by WilliamWhewell (John 2005, 188). So it might
seem like one more piece of Eurocentric appropriation to refer to indigenous
knowledge as sciences, as I will do here. Yet I do so for strategic
reasons. I intend to level the epistemological playing field so that we can
begin to understand the costs to us and to indigenous cultures of conceptualizing
indigenous knowledge only as myth, magic, and superstition,
or only as a residue of tradition that should be replaced by modern Western
sciences’ rationality and technological expertise. Of course there can
be occasions when it is appropriate to focus on the distinctiveness of
modern Western sciences: not all science is Science. However, when triumphalism
is attached to the exceptionalism, it is impossible to avoid the
Eurocentric contrast about which Malinowski and Wiredu have raised
skeptical questions (HARDING, 2015, p. 81)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

This position is that the
members of any supposedly primitive society only enter human history
at the point when Westerners encounter them. (HARDING, 2015, p. 81)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

According to this view, it would be a great
benefit to them if their knowledge seeking, social institutions, and everyday
life were transformed by Western scientific rationality and technological
expertise, as occurred in Europe. (HARDING, 2015, p. 82)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Ward Goodenough (1996) suggests that navigational systems such as
those of Micronesians could be classified as practical sciences. (HARDING, 2015, p. 82)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Whether it is science,
or craft, or art, or a mix of all three is a matter of how
one chooses to fit it into Western intellectual categories about
which we Western intellectuals are ourselves in some disagreement
(42). (HARDING, 2015, p. 82)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Especially useful are what we would call astronomy,
climatology, oceanography, and cartography. Moreover, significant
social, economic, and political knowledge and skills are necessary for
successful navigation. (HARDING, 2015, p. 83)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Westerners continue today to regard indigenous
knowledge as not real science—Â as we learn, for example, from
media reports of the legal struggles over what intellectual property rights
indigenous knowers can draw on against the pharmaceutical companies
that plunder their plant materials and their knowledge of how to use
them (Brush 1996; Foster 2012). (HARDING, 2015, p. 87)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Yet the dissemination of scientific theories, observations,
and methods has conventionally been characterized by Westerners
as a one-Â way trip from the West to the rest. (HARDING, 2015, p. 88)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

So the point here is not to criticize the practice of learning or appropriating
from other knowledge systems, but rather to criticize other intellectually,
ethically, and politically unattractive aspects of this practice
in the history and present practices of the West (HARDING, 2015, p. 88)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Another is the failure to acknowledge
modern Western sciences’ role in such exploitation. It is one problem
to do wrong and a second to fail to admit it (as crisis management
consultants often tell their corporate clients). (HARDING, 2015, p. 88)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Finally, there is the reliance on conventional epistemological
and ontological contrasts which persistently situate our own accomplishments
in Eurocentric and colonialist exceptionalist and triumphalist
positions, and everyone else’s endeavors in an entirely different and
inferior category. (HARDING, 2015, p. 88)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Prevailing philosophies of science claim that modern sciences have
left behind such culturally local and anthropomorphic beliefs and practices
originating in our own traditions. But critics point out how they
have not. Historians and ethnographers have thoroughly documented
the extensive myth, magic, religion, and anthropomorphism that can be
found in modern Western sciences from their origins through the present
day (Jacob 1988; Nader 1996; Noble 1995; Yates 1969). (HARDING, 2015, p. 89)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Worse yet for the conventional contrast between
these sciences and indigenous knowledge systems, it turns out that these
cultural legacies, including, for example, specifically Christian and even
Protestant commitments in the West, are often productive of the advance
of scientific knowledge. These cultural legacies characterize the
very best of modern Western sciences, not just the worst, as Thomas S.
Kuhn (1970) famously began to grasp half a century ago. (HARDING, 2015, p. 89)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The conventional
Western account of their achievements focuses on how they have advanced
through the genius and hard work of scientists: the preoccupation
with testing hypotheses against the material facts, and with standardizing
their practices and languages in ways that permit them more easily
to be used by peoples from different cultures. (HARDING, 2015, p. 89)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

To what
extent did Western expansion through imperialism and colonialism
make valuable contributions to the advance of Western sciences? How
did it also result in tragic destruction of competitive indigenous knowledge
systems, in the course of which those sciences provided provisions
for Western expansion (Hobson 2004)? To what extent does a continuing
hostility to Islam over many centuries mask the extensive groundings
of modern Western sciences in ancient Islamic and Arabic achievements?
Such questions engender larger ones. Must the projects of modern Western
sciences remain mostly directed toward nationalist, military, and
profiteering goals, even against the intentions of the scientists involved? (HARDING, 2015, p. 90)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

We
should also recognize that, these days, new forms of indigenous knowledge
are being produced by indigenous peoples who have developed the
distinctive skills to function effectively both as members of their indigenous
groups and as vigorous participants in local, national, and international
negotiations with people not from their own groups. (HARDING, 2015, p. 91)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Modernization theories have held that as Western scientific rationality
and technical expertise have disseminated around the globe through
so-Â called development projects, they will replace the myth, magic, and
superstition that have played such a big role in maintaining the supposedly
backward and primitive non-Â Western societies and their inferior
knowledge systems. (HARDING, 2015, p. 91)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Moreover,
it is not that Third World science and technology policy makers and intellectuals
do not want access to greater scientific rationality and technical
expertise. Rather, they want it on their own terms, which requires
also preserving and developing significant aspects of their local knowledge
systems (HARDING, 2015, p. 91)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Contrary to Eurocentric assumptions,
such knowledge systems have been continually tested and adapted to
changing natural and social environments, often for centuries and even
millennia. They have enabled those cultures to interact effectively with
their environments throughout their long histories. Thus, these sciences
tend to be empirically reliable and predictive in the relevant natural and
social environments, as the examples reported above indicate (Appleton
et al. 1995; Goodenough 1996; Scott 1996; Selin 2006). (HARDING, 2015, p. 92)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Moreover, this knowledge is what has
both motivated and enabled indigenous peoples to preserve the environments
on which they depend for food, shelter, health remedies, and
other necessities of daily life (as the example of the Cree hunters indicates). (HARDING, 2015, p. 92)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Moreover, loss of human languages also results
in loss of environmental knowledge. Human languages are disappearing
every year, along with the cultures of their speakers. Sustaining
global biodiversity turns out to depend at least to some extent on
the sustaining of cultures and their languages (HARDING, 2015, p. 92)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

There still are many societies around the globe
that do not have access to Western medicine, pharmacology, food production,
or manufacturing. These often are the most remote societies,
or those of the poorest of the poor. Such cultures exist also in industrialized
nations, in both rural and urban environments. Their physical
survival today often depends upon being able to take care of their own
needs for food, housing, clothing, travel, health, medical, and pharmacological
practices, and to protect themselves from often dangerous and
increasingly impoverished urban and rural environments (HARDING, 2015, p. 93)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Thus, indigenous knowledge systems
are a central part of these cultures’ sense of themselves, who they are,
and what they value in life. (HARDING, 2015, p. 94)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

These culturally embedded indigenous knowledge systems are a rich resource
for the advance of human knowledge. It is precisely their roots in
distinctive cultural legacies that enable them to come up with continuingly
innovative and valuable responses to changing social and natural
environments. (HARDING, 2015, p. 95)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Moreover, when Westerners assign other cultures’ knowledge systems
to the “uninteresting” premodern world, we thereby turn these
groups into “peoples without history,” as we noted Eric Wolf famously
put the point about European historians’ standard treatment of peasants
(Wolf 1984). (HARDING, 2015, p. 95)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Many well-Â 
intentioned and otherwise progressive accounts of science and technology
around the globe today tend to dismiss attempts to reevaluate these
legacies as mere nativism or identity politics. (HARDING, 2015, p. 95)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

And such studies can begin to reveal
previously obscured histories of the West, as indicated by Hobson’s
(2004) documentation of “the oriental West,” mentioned above. J. M.
Blaut (1993) identifies many conceptual practices that enable Europeans
to find it appropriate to ignore other cultures’ roles in the creation of
the modern Western world. One, for example, is the “tunnel of time,”
by which we modern Westerners reclaim classical Greek achievements
for ourselves alone, ignoring the long and fruitful history of the Greek
legacy in Arabic and other non-Â Western cultures, and how these cultures
also contributed to the advancement of the West. (HARDING, 2015, p. 96)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Other cultures have asked
different questions about different environments, drawn on distinctive
local discursive traditions, and used methods unfamiliar or disvalued
in the West. Commercial enterprises, from colonial economic botany
through today’s Big Pharma, have always understood how valuable
these other knowledge systems are. (HARDING, 2015, p. 96)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Is it only the indigenous
societies that should be assigned the responsibility for reversing
such losses? If not, what are appropriate roles for Western societies in
such a project? And how should indigenous knowledge be preserved and
nourished? (HARDING, 2015, p. 96)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Instead, we can
reevaluate in which contexts these remain useful and in which they create
unnecessary obstacles to our goal of advancing sciences for multicultural,
democratic societies. We can begin to recognize the roles these
binaries play in, for example, the difficulty of fully adopting an environmental
ethic, as Scott pointed out above. (HARDING, 2015, p. 97)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Our epistemologies are regarded as “underdeveloped” by Third World
science and technology intellectuals (Nandy 1990; Third World Network
1993). It turns out that it is we who in significant respects are the
intellectually, politically, and ethically underdeveloped societies, incapable
of grasping our own locations in world history. (HARDING, 2015, p. 98)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Let me remind readers that the argument here is not that indigenous
peoples should have access only to their indigenous knowledge systems,
leaving modern Western sciences firmly in Western hands. Many non-Â 
Westerners participate in the production of modern Western sciences in
their own labs at home and in the West; (HARDING, 2015, p. 98)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Before directly addressing the issue of how
to block its entrance, it will be worthwhile to identify five kinds of relations
between modern Western sciences and indigenous knowledge systems
that currently exist and which, it is to be hoped, will continue to be
developed. (HARDING, 2015, p. 99)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

This fact is what stimulated
Susantha Goonatilake (1998) to argue that it is crucial to global human
flourishing to gather into modern Western sciences these legacies of environmental,
medical, and other kinds of knowledge. We should try to
integrate them into our sciences as best can be done. One cannot just
go out and develop a feminist science or an Islamic science to replace
modern Western science, he argues, with respect to such existing proposals
(e.g., Harding 1986; Sardar 1997).(HARDING, 2015, p. 99)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Yet we can note, as Goonatilake
does, that only a limited part of such indigenous knowledge systems
can be appropriated, translated, or smoothly “sutured” into modern
Western science, since the conflicting epistemological, ontological, and
methodological aspects of the appropriated sciences will not fit into the
modern Western science conceptual framework. (HARDING, 2015, p. 100)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

A second strategy is for non-Â Western societies to try to delink
from Western ones. In response to the conventional image of modern
Western science that Goonatilake assumes, critics have argued for other
societies simply to withdraw from the modern West (HARDING, 2015, p. 100)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Of course, it is not possible for societies to delink from each other
completely in our networked social and natural worlds, as these critics
well understand. Ozone holes; climate change; acid rain; nuclear leaks;
pandemics; plant, animal, and human migrations; the armaments trade;
sex work; drug networks; terrorism; and other such phenomena do not
respect national or any other attempted social boundaries. Coordination
and cooperation are crucial in every society to avoid the bad effects
of such phenomena. (HARDING, 2015, p. 101)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

A third relation
is for elements of modern Western sciences to be integrated into
other cultures’ sciences and technologies.(HARDING, 2015, p. 101)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Scientists in many fields today increasingly collaborate on
scientific projects with indigenous knowers. Whether no longer willing
or no longer permitted to engage in the intellectual piracy of the past,
archaeologists, agriculturalists, medical and health scientists, and environmentalists,
to mention just a few obvious examples, have actively
developed jointly designed and managed projects (HARDING, 2015, p. 102)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

We could take a different perspective on the
first proposal, and try to transform modern Western sciences through
precisely the ontological and epistemological “borrowings” that most
conflict with those of modern Western sciences, not just with the elements
that can be perfectly slipped into the conceptual framework of
modern Western sciences. (HARDING, 2015, p. 102)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

We can recognize
that modern Western sciences, too, have produced empirically
reliable results of research within frameworks from Western religious
traditions (HARDING, 2015, p. 102)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

To take another example, many non-Â Western cultures have learned
to live with both their own indigenous knowledge systems and with
modern Western sciences, even when there are deep conflicts between
them.(HARDING, 2015, p. 102)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Which one of these relations between indigenous and modern Western
scientific knowledge will prevail? My view is that we should not rank
these, choosing only one or several over the others. (HARDING, 2015, p. 103)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The demon of relativism doesn’t get to take over such conversations
if we keep in focus the fact that these diverse knowledge systems are
practically useful for particular, always local, social projects. How to
deal with chronic pain? Which agricultural practices work best for this
particular local environment? It is the practical aspect of the way people
select which knowledge strategy on which to rely that insures that
relativist issues can’t arise (HARDING, 2015, p. 103)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Who gets to settle these many issues raised by the possibility of positive
reevaluations of the strengths of indigenous knowledge systems? Such
issues are going to be with us long into the twenty-Â first century as we
in the West try to figure out just how and how not to leave behind the
Eurocentric, androcentric, and positivist tendencies that so powerfully
shaped the last century’s scientific and technology research (HARDING, 2015, p. 103)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

A number of philosophers
and historians have begun to explore how modern Western sciences—Â 
biology, quantum physics, and even mathematics—Â are today clearly
disunified and plural (HARDING, 2015, p. 106)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Finally, looking at these issues from another angle, historical studies
have proposed that it was only political threats that forced mid–Â 
twentieth century philosophy of science to retreat toward the kind of
logical empiricist (logical positivist) commitments to the singularity of
sciences and their autonomy from society and, especially, from politics
that so many of us were taught were the unquestionable commitments
within which we could plan our own work (HARDING, 2015, p. 106)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

So it is not just the rise of global multiculturalism and postcolonialism
that brings such new scientific, epistemological, and ontological
questions into sharp focus. So, too, do some homegrown historical and
philosophic sources of fresh thought about such issues. These changes
also have the effect of decreasing the cognitive distance between modern
Western sciences and other cultures’ knowledge systems. What should
be our standards for objective research in light of this recent work? What
could constitute standards for fairness to the data and to our severest
critics? (HARDING, 2015, p. 107)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

In our fascination with the disunity
arguments, we shouldn’t forget that unity has long been a political
and social ideal, enshrined in the very names of the United States, the
European Union, and, not so long ago, the Soviet Union (HARDING, 2015, p. 107)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Even as we still struggle to create needed unities, calls for disunity, difference,
autonomy, and independence reverberate across political debates
around the globe; indeed, they are visible in discussions of theÂ€reÂ 
cent global financial crisis. (HARDING, 2015, p. 108)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Thus we can see that unity and disunity are not facts of nature or of
social relations. They are not “out there” to be discovered, in the way
that we were taught to think of the facts of gravity or tectonic plates as
waiting to be discovered. Rather, they are usefully understood as discourses,
as ways of making order out of the “blooming, buzzing confusion”
of everyday experience.2 Indeed, the related contrast between
similarities and differences also are not “out there” to be found, but
rather always require us to characterize phenomena in one way rather
than another. (HARDING, 2015, p. 108)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Of course everyone recognizes that physics, chem
istry,
geology, crystallography, and genetics, for example, are different
sciences. But the logical empiricists argued that such sciences can in
principle and should in practice be unified into a coherent methodologi
cal,
linguistic, ontological, and/or epistemological whole. They thought
that our understanding of nature’s order should in principle match what
was presumed to be the coherence of that order (HARDING, 2015, p. 108)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The uniqueness of scientific method could be accurately character
ized,
they thought. A materialist ontology must continue to replace the
supernatural ones still found in folk thought and religious institutions,
and in their practices and cultures around the globe. They feared that
supernatural beliefs could again nourish hideous political projects. They
assumed that a representational scheme could be identified within which
all scientific descriptions of nature’s order could be articulated (HARDING, 2015, p. 109)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

This vision of science continues to allure. In spite of the aforemen

tioned
social contexts that make disunity and pluralism seem reason
able
and desirable, many scientists, philosophers, public intellectuals,
and everyday citizens continue to find it painful to contemplate giving
up this vision. On what do they focus when they are contemplating such
pain? Such pain was visible in the “science wars” of the late 1990s, in
which scientists and other intellectuals feared that theories and analy
ses
by feminists and postmodernists were encouraging irrationality and
disrespect in the public toward the benefits of scientific research, and
thereby causing reductions in financing for scientific research (HARDING, 2015, p. 109)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

This is precisely what distinguishes modern Western sciences from
dogma, as well as from folk knowledge and traditional belief, according
to this view. (HARDING, 2015, p. 111)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Moreover, the perpetrators of rape, child molestation, slav

ery,
genocide, and other hideous social practices thrive on contrafactual
claims that the victims desired or deserved what happened to them. Ra
dio
talk shows are full of the racist and sexist rantings of some of our
citizens who refuse to consider facts of the matter (among their other
limitations) (HARDING, 2015, p. 111)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

As the disunity
theorists have noted, ideals of unity and disunity are lodged deeply in
national identities and public discourses in the West (HARDING, 2015, p. 111)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

From the perspective of this narra
tive,
Feyerabend’s (1975) “against method,” wherein “anything goes”
methodologically, was an early attempt to develop an anti
-
-Â.authoritarian
philosophy of science. Today, such tendencies are again pursued in the
new concerns with difference and disunity (HARDING, 2015, p. 112)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

As a result, some philosophers began to explore the possibility and
consequences of giving up the typical armchair rational reconstructions
of scientific inquiry and developing “naturalized” philosophies of sci
ence
grounded in the new accounts of actual practices of working sci
entists (HARDING, 2015, p. 113)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

But
how deep down into ontological, epistemological, and meth
odological
assumptions would this disunity and pluralism have to ex
tend? (HARDING, 2015, p. 113)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The postcolonial interest in disunity represents a theme that ap

pears
also in the other anti-Â.
a
authoritarian social movements that began

to emerge in the 1960s and 1970s. Feminist, antiracist, anticlass, queer,
and disability social movements were developing theories about the plu
rality
of sciences around the globe and programs to advance sciences
with different agendas and methods than those of modern Western sci
ences
and its philosophies. Recognition of multiplicity in philosophic
positions about this “world of sciences” appeared in this work as it fo
cused
on the different metaphors, models, ontologies, and epistemolo
Â
gies of, for example, Native American and African environmental proj

ects,
or contemporary Asian health and medical projects (HARDING, 2015, p. 120)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

There is an admirable element to this otherwise problematic claim.
This is that neither scientific nor philosophic positions should claim
complete closure. Every claim and position should be left open to further
discussion as new conditions and perspectives emerge. Yet to insist that
this must be an “empirical question” fails to recognize that the unity and
disunity of nature and of theories about nature are discourses, not facts.
And at this moment and place in history and social relations, the unity
position discounts the value of a “world of sciences” to non-

Â.Western so

cieties
as well as to Western ones (as described in chapter 3) (HARDING, 2015, p. 121)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

It is the residual tendency to seek global, universal epistemological
guarantees for the reliability of modern Western sciences that contin
ues
to fuel fears of the undervaluation of nature’s powers and the legiti
mation
of a pernicious cultural relativism (HARDING, 2015, p. 122)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

S
tump notes that it was Kuhn, Feyerabend, and other philosophers
of their era who introduced the possibility that relativism was going to
be a serious challenge to philosophies of science—Â.n
Â.not just to attempts

to justify moral principles, where it had found a home for more than
two millenia. For these philosophers, scientists in the thrall of different
research paradigms lived in “different worlds.” The “incommensurabil
ity”
of those worlds made it exceedingly difficult to convince devotees of
one paradigm to leave it behind and migrate into the lived world of a
competing paradigm (HARDING, 2015, p. 123)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Yet Willard Van Orman Quine
(1960), too, had posed the epistemological problem: he insisted that ob
servations
can never be completely independent of the theories they are
supposed to be testing. Scientific and everyday thought form a contin
uum,
a “network of belief,” with no sharp break dividing one from the
other (HARDING, 2015, p. 124)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

This heterogeneity insures that some elements
of scientific practice are at least relatively autonomous from the scientist’s
theoretical commitments and thus can indeed do the kind of critical work
for which the sciences are so valued (HARDING, 2015, p. 124)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

And in this last discussed kind of dis

unity
we can see another reason to resist the temptation to rank modern
Western sciences higher than other cultures’ knowledge systems on the
grounds that the others do not possess consistent logics of scientific in
quiry (HARDING, 2015, p. 125)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Yet powerful residues of the unity of science
thesis about sciences remain wherever the philosophic attempts to de
feat
it continue to avoid thoughtful consideration of the role of science
in society and society in science: how sciences and their societies co
Â
pro
duce each other (HARDING, 2015, p. 126)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

From their
origins half a millennium ago, modern Western sciences
positioned themselves against the “enchanted world”
—Â
t
hat is, against the idea that our lives and environments
are designed, managed, and permeated by supernatural
forces (HARDING, 2015, p. 127)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

It also remains deeply embedded in educated Western identities to
day.
Of course many scientists in the Global North do regularly par
ticipate
in religious practices. Yet the vast majority of them would insist
that their professional production of scientific facts is not shaped by
their religious or spiritual experiences, commitments, or practices (HARDING, 2015, p. 128)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

So there are plenty of examples around us of
scientists insisting on secular ways of producing claims about nature’s
order. (HARDING, 2015, p. 128)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

It turns out that every religion produces its own
secularism (or maybe several) (HARDING, 2015, p. 129)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Can sciences directed by or aligned with secularism actually
maximize the objectivity of their research projects (HARDING, 2015, p. 129)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The distinction between secular and religious/spiritual commitments is
central to the multicultural democratic states in which Western sciences
have developed (HARDING, 2015, p. 130)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The binaries of reason versus dogma
and progress versus backwardness have most often benefited from their
association with the secularism versus religion binary, in turn strength
ening
the appeal of the latter. (HARDING, 2015, p. 130)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Societies around the globe are becoming ever more extensively inter
linked
through the expansion of popular culture, communication, travel,
and capitalism. They need to confront shared problems such as global
warming, migration, pandemics, the management of oceans and other
shared resources, the sex trade and other illegal activities, warfare, and
terrorism within and between states (HARDING, 2015, p. 130)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

To non

-Â.Western critics, Western secularism is also seen as a symp

tom
of the Western lack of critical self
-Â.
-Â.analysis
regarding what appear as
clearly religious and cultural values and interests that also infuse West
ern
sciences and their philosophies, as well as other supposedly secular
social beliefs and practices (HARDING, 2015, p. 131)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

How ironic that Western secularism, initiated to support tolerance of
multicultural religious communities in democratic states, now appears
to so many people around the globe (including fundamentalist Chris
tians
in the United States) as a vehicle of religious intolerance, an obsta
cle
to democratic social relations, and a symptom of the epistemological
ignorance and backwardness of the modern West! What is to be done? (HARDING, 2015, p. 132)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

According to the West, modernization
required the transfer of (secular) scientific rationality and technical ex
pertise
from the West to the underdeveloped societies. With the reces
sion,
questions arose about how free of specifically Western, capitalist,
expansionist, and neoliberal democratic values were modernization the
ory,
its development projects, and the scientific rationality and technical
expertise that they delivered (Escobar 1995; Sachs 1992). (HARDING, 2015, p. 134)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Rather, it
is pluralism, inclusivity (diversity!), that is so important to the establish
ment
of democratic social relations. It is dogmatism, whether religious
or secular, that advances discrimination against people (HARDING, 2015, p. 134)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Given that religion and spirituality often are important components
of the lives of people of color, a philosophy that is hostile to religion
tends to produce a chilly climate for them. That chilly climate helps
ensure the ongoing whiteness of philosophy by implicitly discouraging
people of color to enter and remain in the academic discipline of phi
losophy. (HARDING, 2015, p. 135)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

That is, philosophers often
implicitly dismiss religious and spiritual commitments as irrelevant to
philosophic issues. But they seem to have little concern with the effect
their overt, public dismissals will have on those who do have religious
and spiritual experiences. They don’t worry about being rude or insult
ing
to their colleagues or readers in such comments. (HARDING, 2015, p. 136)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Sullivan argues that the issues that are central to the academic fiel
of philosophy of religion—

Â.such as questions about God’s existence and
nature, the problem of evil, reasons for (dis)believing in miracles, the

relationship of faith and reason, and the relationship between religion
and morality—
Â.t
Â.tend
to appear irrelevant to many people of color in
the United States (HARDING, 2015, p. 136)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Sulli
van’sÂ€
account recognizes that for the African Americans on whom she
focuses, religion and spirituality are linked to their daily experience as
they “struggle for social-Â.p

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Consider, for example, historians’ accounts of early mod

scientists using experimental method to understand God’s mind in
even greater detail, or attempting to achieve salvation through seeking
knowledge. (HARDING, 2015, p. 138)

Jakobsen and Pellegrini (2000b) point out
how this dominant secularism narrative also justifies colonial violence. (HARDING, 2015, p. 138)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The moment that a religion specifies what counts as its necessary prac
tices,
it also specifies what will count as being nonobservant—
Â.a
Â.as that

particular religion’s secularism. The typical contrast between religion
and secularism is only half accurate. This perspective on secularisms
is reinforced by recognizing that many Western scholars have argued
that modernities, rationalities, and sciences should be conceptualized
as plural (a topic addressed in chapter 5.) (HARDING, 2015, p. 139)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

The contrast be
tween
modernity and tradition invoked by modern Western disvalu
ations
of indigenous knowledge has come under criticism from several
perspectives. From a postmodern perspective, scholars have given us
historicizations of many of the supposedly universally valid bedrock as
sumptions
that are said to indicate the distinctive character of mod
ern
Western sciences, such as objectivity, rationality, scientific method,
and the glassy

-Â.mirror mind of the observer, in Richard Rorty’s (1979)
phrase. (HARDING, 2015, p. 141)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Meanwhile, postcolo

nial
critics have interrogated the reliability of any accounts of what con
stitutes
the traditions of a culture, and thus provide a critique of the
modernity

-Â.tradition contrast from another angle (HARDING, 2015, p. 141)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Here the focus is on Daston and Galison’s argument that that scien
tists’
senses of themselves as being engaged in the highest moral pursuits
are repeatedly challenged with each new objectivity practice (HARDING, 2015, p. 142)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

My point here is that this science studies discussion of the moral di
mensions
of epistemology aligns with claims that religious and spiritual
elements of knowledge seeking do not necessarily damage the accuracy
or reliability of the results of that research (HARDING, 2015, p. 143)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

On the one hand, patriarchal religions have rightly been blamed for
justifying and enforcing women’s subjugation, often in hideous ways
—Â
from witch hunts, widow burning, and honor killings to brutal control of women’s marriage and reproductive practices. (HARDING, 2015, p. 143-144)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Another issue is that feminist secularism in the Global North has
again and again had the effect—
Â.an
d sometimes the intention—Â.o
Â.of
ad
vancing
racism and colonialism. (HARDING, 2015, p. 144)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

In recent years such alignments have been especially visible when
feminists in the Global North have sought to improve conditions for
women in the Global South by criticizing the religiously or culturally
sanctioned treatment of women in ways that the North regards as vio
lations
of human rights (HARDING, 2015, p. 145)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Thus, feminist analyses have shown how feminist secularists have
been as unaware as their brothers of how their secularism has had dam
aging
effects on Southern peoples and their knowledge systems (HARDING, 2015, p. 145)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

And, as I have been arguing, it is a problem more
generally that Western secularist standards of “good science” automati
cally
reject as myth, magic, and superstition knowledge systems that are
grounded in non

-Â.Western religious and spiritual commitments. All that
said, of course
scientific research often raises moral and political issues;
this is certainly not new. The position here is that these issues require
public debate with full participation of all stakeholders. (We return to
some of these issues in chapter 7.) (HARDING, 2015, p. 146)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Yet it seems legitimate to, for example, require students applying
for university admission to evidence satisfactory grades in a high school
evolutionary biology course, whatever other courses they may have also
taken, as a California judge ruled several years ago. (HARDING, 2015, p. 146)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Let me put the issue another way: My point here is to refuse to “take
sides” with respect to the truth of people’s favored creation narratives.
Everyone should be permitted to follow their own inclinations on such
issues (with appropriate caveats about hate speech and harming others). (HARDING, 2015, p. 147)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

I have been arguing that the Western exceptionalist and triumphalist
secularist stance needs rethinking if we are to arrive at a philosophy of
science with more desirable intellectual and political consequences. (HARDING, 2015, p. 148)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Moreover, because women tend to be positioned differently than
their brothers in relation to their cultures’ religious and moral principles,
they have sometimes been able to use such positions not only to improve
their own conditions, but also to transform their religions. (HARDING, 2015, p. 149)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

that ho
mogenous
communities of researchers lack the resources to detect many
of the community-Â.
-Â.wide values and interests that shape their own as

sumptions,
policies, and practices (HARDING, 2015, p. 151)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Yet even
when such communities can’t detect how, for example, militaristic or
corporate values are directing their research, their research produces
guns that shoot accurately and seeds that tend to produce the crops in
tended.
So it must be a mistake to assume that research shaped by social
values and interests invariably will be empirically unreliable (HARDING, 2015, p. 151)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Moreover,
the concept of strong objectivity does capture “real objectivity” in a cru
cial
sense. While it abandons the requirement that maximally objective
research must be value-

-Â.free, it requires that research be fair to all existing

evidence and to its severest critics. And this fairness doctrine was always
the foundation of the original requirement for value-

Â.freedom. Thus, the
strong objectivity project counters the fatal limitations of the value-

Â.free
doctrine for maximizing objectivity. (HARDING, 2015, p. 151)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Research directed by feminist and postcolonial values and interests
revealed that many of the assumptions about women and poor people in
the Global South that had guided development policy in the World Bank
and other institutions controlled by the Global North turned out to be
false. (HARDING, 2015, p. 152)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

the reliability of indigenous knowledge systems even though
they are always embedded in culturally local assumptions and interests.
Because they are so embedded, modern Western scientists have regarded
indigenous knowledge as unreliable, as not “real science.” (HARDING, 2015, p. 152)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Modern Western sciences have had a peculiar relation to these
knowledge systems. On the one hand, as indicated, the latter are usually
dismissed as not really scientific, precisely because they are so embed
ded
in cultural values and interests (HARDING, 2015, p. 152)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

While indigenous systems
clearly have been highly successful in enabling effective interactions with
their local natural and social worlds, they have their limitations, as does
every knowledge system (HARDING, 2015, p. 153)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Apparently such differences between
scientific traditions extend into their ontologies and epistemologies (HARDING, 2015, p. 153)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Soon
these scientist-

Â.philosophers, many of whom were Jewish, began to emi

grate
from Germany and Austria mostly to the United States. But here
they and their philosophy of science encountered the anticommunism
and antisemitism of McCarthyism and the Cold War. Their philosophy
had to be radically reshaped. They scaled back its concerns to those
that could be regarded as value
-Â.f
-Â.free by such political forces, as some

of them
—Â.n
—Â.namely Reichenbach and Carnap—
Â.e
Â.earlier had intended their
work
to be (HARDING, 2015, p. 154)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

So was this supposedly value
-Â.f
-Â.free “scientific” philosophy politically
committed or not? After half a century of science studies, it seems more
reasonable to see it as having been twice shaped by resistance to the

politics it encountered: first fascism and antisemitism, and then Mc
Â
Ca
rthyism and the Cold War. Its insistence that the objectivity of sci
ence
depends on the value
-
-Â.freedom
of its methods and results of research
was itself simultaneously a commitment to a philosophy of science free
of fascist and Cold War politics, and a specific political response to po
litical
threats against its adherents (HARDING, 2015, p. 154)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

A fifth argument considered the related issue
of the claimed secularism of modern Western societies and their sci
ences.
It pointed out that in many contexts, the binary of science versus
religion is not really helpful. For one thing, secularisms are plural, and
always are constituted within particular sets of religious and spiritual
beliefs and practices (HARDING, 2015, p.155)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

So examples can
be found in modern Western sciences of how even spiritual and reli
gious
experiences, beliefs, and interests need not damage the reliability
of scientific research results. In fact, the historians argue, they can have
positive effects on such work. (HARDING, 2015, p. 155)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Sciences and their societies co-
-Â.produce
and co-
Â.constitute
each
other. Yet it is important to recollect that this co
-
-Â.production thesis was
clear
earlier to antiracist, anticlass, and feminist social movement (HARDING, 2015, p. 156)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

T
heir focus on the relation of
objectivity to subjectivity draws attention to otherwise unanalyzed ethi
cal
dimensions of scientific practice and of the classical modern “proper
scientific self.” (HARDING, 2015, p. 156)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Of course the Enlightenment’s disengaged,
autonomous, rational subject of knowledge and of history has been un
der
attack since the nineteenth century, and with renewed energy in
the last few decades. Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Weber, and Marx are
influential nineteenth
-Â.c
-Â.century sources of this skeptical attitude (Flax

1986; Taylor 1989). (HARDING, 2015, p. 157)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

At the
origins, everyday life occurred in the “enchanted world” of Roman Ca
tholicism.
A form of reason that was disengaged from that world was
necessary to support the materialism of that world as modernity would
describe it. It is the control of the knowledge
-Â.s
-Â.seeking self through dis

tinctive
research processes that maximizes such disengagement and thus
produces a distinctive form of rationality. But the disengagement of this
reason from everyday social experiences at the origin of modernity is in tension with today’s feminist and class-Â.based moral positions that
insist on the affirmation of ordinary life, exemplified by the activities of
the family and of economic production respectively, Taylor argues (23,
478) (HARDING, 2015, p. 157-158)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

But we can ask whether Taylor is right that a focus on scientific pro
cedures
must have such self-Â.
d
defeating consequences for the social jus

tice
movements. Though he approvingly cites feminist critiques of the
modern self (though only on the next-

Â.to
-
-Â.last page of his book),7 he does
not recognize or engage with the feminist moral goals or “goods” that
have produced this criticism and gone on to design such value-Â.r
-Â.rich
re
search
processes in the first place (HARDING, 2015, p. 158)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Rather, modernity had again
and again been defined against whatever counted as the feminine or
the womanly (Felski 1995; Harding 2008; Jardine 1985; Scott 1995). (HARDING, 2015, p. 159)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Thus, feminist theory had produced a different account of the “cri
sis
of modernity” and of “Western epistemology” than that recounted
by Taylor. Often informed by the feminist postmodern theorists, the ar
gument
was that these crises were in fact crises of dominant masculin
ism.
Modernity and its epistemology were from their beginnings deeply
permeated by (co-
Â.c
Â.constituted with) male supremacy, and there was no

good reason for feminist strategies intended to advance democracy and
equality to have to fall victim to the crises of masculinism (HARDING, 2015, p. 159)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

And the Others so constituted had no agency; they were
“dupes,” supposedly incapable of resistance to such imperial projects.
What kind of subjects could avoid these two unattractive positions?
How can agency and resistance be posited for (supposedly) nonconsti
tuting
subjects of knowledge and history? A short answer to this ques
tion
is that different subjects can be created through negotiations with
different discourses. Agency and thus resistance are primarily properties
of discourses, not of individuals. Thus, creating more democratic and
egalitarian discourses can produce humans capable of active negotiation
with their social/natural surround (Hekman 1991). (HARDING, 2015, p. 160)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

These are the kinds of shifts that Daston and Galison have in mind
when they say that “the history of objectivity becomes, ipso facto, part of
the history
Â€.Â€.Â€. of the scientific self.” (HARDING, 2015, p. 161)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Ferguson identifies a concept of the self that reveals
how oppressed individuals can in fact resist oppressive practices of well
-Â
institutionalized structural forms of racism, sexism, and other such op

pressive
social relations. At the same time, this must be a concept of the
self such that the perpetrators can be held responsible for their oppres
sive
practices; they are not to be conceptualized as helpless tools of a de
terministic
social order. (HARDING, 2015, p. 161)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Ferguson argues that the self must be conceptu
alized
as a disunified, ongoing, social process, not as a coherent, static,
completely “internal” entity (HARDING, 2015, p. 162)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

This can be done
through creating and/or joining oppositional networks, coalitions, and
communities in daily interactions and critical reflection. Indeed, for Fer
guson,
those of us who would contribute to eliminating oppressive and
exploitative social relations have a moral obligation to seek out and par
ticipate
in such oppositional social groups. (HARDING, 2015, p. 162)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

These authors stress the importance of acknowledging the contradic
tions
such selves entail and of learning to transform such differences into
sources of knowledge and power (HARDING, 2015, p. 163)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Progressive politics, also, has obviously figured out how to
appeal to people’s “better selves” to gain support for desirable social
transformations (HARDING, 2015, p. 164)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Perhaps the earliest articulated
home in the last half of the twentieth century for conscientious posi
tioning
of research projects in progressive social relations is PAR in the
social sciences (HARDING, 2015, p. 165)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

PAR proposed a model of research which rejected fundamental as
sumptions
of the positivist natural science model that had become domi
nant
in the social sciences. It also differentiated itself from ethnographic
research of the day that kept its focus firmly on the internal symbolic
and material relations of unfamiliar cultures, which were most often in
the Global South or among poor or minorities in the Global North (HARDING, 2015, p. 165)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

PAR includes a range of such attempts to redistribute control of re
search
processes in ways that are more accountable to vulnerable com
munities
with stakes in the research (HARDING, 2015, p. 165)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Now, many decades later,
we
can understand why that was so. It took lots of work over several
decades to be able to identify particular aspects of the social relations
of patriarchy, capitalism, traditional societies, and modernization
—Â.t
Â.to

name the main institutional perpetrators of these women’s immiseration
up to that point—

Â.that had to be changed if poor women were to be able
to gain more control over their lives. (HARDING, 2015, p. 166)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

One can see both standpoint methodology and the citizen science
projects described in earlier chapters as being committed in different
ways to similar redistributions of authority in research projects. Neither
is usually conceptualized as a form of PAR. I am suggesting that their
differences notwithstanding, this commitment to the redistribution of
research authority links them to PAR agendas. (HARDING, 2015, p. 167)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Nevertheless, PAR
offers good directions for knowledge seekers who strategically position
their agendas to produce the sciences and philosophies of science that
simultaneously advance the reliability of research and also provide valu
able
information and experience for oppressed communities. (HARDING, 2015, p. 167)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Note that the field of science studies showed the value of using social
science methodologies to understand the natural sciences, their objects
of study, their research processes, and the research ideals that suppos
edly
directed them. In effect, these historians, sociologists, economists,
political scientists, and ethnographers revealed how natural sciences
have always been “thickly” social projects: they have been socially pro
duced
and constituted “all the way down” into their ontologies and epis
temologies. (HARDING, 2015, p. 168)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Consequently, one could say that they turned the natural
sciences into particular forms of social sciences: ones that took as their
objects of study parts of our environments that seem untouched by hu
man
hands. Yet the very act of taking them as objects of study embedded
such “natural phenomena” in cultural narratives and practices. Thus, if
philosophers of science would be “scientific,” as logical empiricism has
always avowed they should be, it turns out they will have to get more fa
miliar
with the social science research goals and strategies that the fiel
of science studies has found useful. (HARDING, 2015, p. 168)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

Consequently
their needs and interests were systematically ignored or distorted in le
gal
contexts, as well as in white feminist and antiracist theory and poli
tics.
Insisting on the recognition of intersectionality required that every
individual and social group be recognized as existing at the intersection
of whatever were the powerful structural elements of the social order.
So black women’s opportunities, responsibilities, and limitations are
shaped by forces of race, gender, and class, among others (HARDING, 2015, p. 168)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

In these proposals for better ways of thinking about individual and
collective knowing subjects and the positionality of their research proj
ects,
one can begin to see how knowers are not fundamentally autono
mous,
self
-Â.c
-Â.creating, culture-
Â.f
Â.free individuals. In a variety of ways, these
accounts draw attention to the researchers’ inevitable and necessary

interactions with networks, communities, or social movements in the
production of knowledge. Or, better, individual researchers inevitably
collaborate with their communities to produce knowledge whether or
not they are aware of this collaboration (HARDING, 2015, p. 169)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

My point here is that a “knowing community” is always dynamic, as
its representative institutions and the citizens that animate them engage
in critical debate, rethinking and revising scientific and technical agendas
and their own roles in advancing them. This desired quality of “knowing
communities” is another aspect of the “scientific selves” that are called
for in recent attempts to relink sciences and their philosophies to demo
cratic
social relations. (HARDING, 2015, p. 173)

<h3>HARDING, </h3>

My argument in this book has been intended to support self
consciously
really, really big philosophy of science in every research dis
cipline
(not just philosophy departments) that seeks out and promotes
the underrepresented insights and critical perspectives of economically,
socially, and politically vulnerable groups in the West and around the
globe. Such a recognition of the resources that the cognitive or intel
lectual
norm of objectivity and the social justice norm of diversity can
bring to each other promises to relink sciences and their philosophies to
the democratic goals that can enable modern Western sciences and their
philosophies to earn the designation of being universally valued—
Â.e
—Â.even

though they are never uniquely so. (HARDING, 2015, p. 174)
