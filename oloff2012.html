<h3>OLOFF, ZUMBI, CAPITALISMO, ESCRAVIDÃO, COLONIALISMO, NATUREZA</h3>

The figure of the zombie is an ideal figure to think through the relations between society and nature under capitalism from an eco-materialist perspective. Its origins lie in the Haitian experience of slavery and the plantation economy; its subsequent travels have transformed it into the fundamental symbol of alienation under capitalism. (OLOFF, 2012:31)

<h3>OLOFF, ZUMBI, CAPITALISMO, NATUREZA</h3>
Building on Shaviro's claim, I want to suggest that while the zombie is indeed the 'human face' of capitalist monstrosity, it is also an ecological figure, encoding the rift between humans and their
natural environment perpetrated by capitalism, an economic system that centrally depends on the 'downgrading or devaluing of nature' (Mukherjee 2010: 66).(OLOFF, 2012:31)

<h3>OLOFF, ZUMBI, COLONIZAÇÃO, EXPLORAÇÃO</h3>
The zombie's continued relevance as a figure that encodes alienation is rooted in the Haitian experience of the emergence of modern capitalism, which depended on, and was propelled by, the exploitation of the colonies. Since the exploitation of both labour and lands was central to this process, the production of the alterity of 'nature' and the colonial subject were intimately intertwined on an ideological level. (OLOFF, 2012:31)

<h3>OLOFF, COLONIZAÇÃO, NATUREZA, IMPERIALISMO</h3>
 Colonial subjects were thus routinely
seen as closer to nature, and opposed to the supposedly rational space of civilization.
Hence, in order to arrive at a decolonized conception of the subject, one must not
only re-conceptualize the relation between {imperial) self and (colonial) other, but
also between humans and nature-as-other. (OLOFF, 2012:31)

<h3>OLOFF, ZUMBI, CAPITALISMO</h3>
In the first section of this paper, I turn to the Marxist environmental historian
Jason W. Moore in order to theorise the zombie as a figure that, due to its origins that
stem from the Caribbean's forced integration into the world economy, mediates and
encodes the metabolic rift produced by capitalism. (OLOFF, 2012:32)

<h3>OLOFF, NATUREZA, </h3>
Zombies have in recent years
been imagined as consumers, shoppers and monsters driven by hunger, but they
could never be imagined as small-scale independent farmers. This seemingly obvious
observation will lead us to the heart of the meaning of the zombie. (OLOFF, 2012:32)

<h3>OLOFF, ZUMBI, HISTÓRIA</h3>
 In accordance with his observation, there are three key phases
in the zombie's ecological history: its emergence and folk-tale existence within the
colonial plantation system; its appropriation by US writers and integration into the
US imaginary during the early twentieth century, as the new imperial power was
continuing to move outward to exploit natural resources outside its own terrain; and
its increased popularity towards the end of the twentieth century as a corollary of
the neoliberal phase that, as Moore puts it, has failed to generate the agro-ecological
conditions for renewed growth (2010: 390). (OLOFF,2012:32)
    
<h3>OLOFF, ZUMBI, IMPERIALISMO, VOODOO</h3>
    The original Haitian zombie is quite different from that popularised in recent years by
Hollywood cinema: either a bodiless spirit or a soulless body, it is intimately linked
to vodou (a complex creolized religion that has been much reviled in the imperialist
imaginary). The soulless body is raised from the grave or has had its soul stolen while
still alive (often through the administration of poison). It is controlled by a vodou
sorcerer and becomes a 'beast of burden, which his master exploits without mercy'
(Metraux 1972: 282). (OLOFF, 2012:33)

<h3>OLOFF, ZUMBI, MEDO</h3>
The most
important difference between Hollywood and Haitian conceptions of zombies is that
Haitians do not fear zombies but may 'live in fear of being zombified themselves'
(Fernandez Olmos and Paravisini-Gebert 2003: 129). (OLOFF, 2012:33)

<h3>OLOFF, ZUMBI, ESCRAVIDÃO, EXPLORAÇÃO, COLONIZAÇÃO</h3>
In the
Haitian context, the zombie - whether docile or rebellious - is a figure whose roots
in the experience of brutal enslavement and exploitation are readily discernible. It
bears the marks of extreme human deprivation, as well as, arguably, those of extreme
ecological deprivation and of human alienation from the natural environment, now
re-shaped by colonial monocultures.(OLOFF, 2012:34)

<h3>OLOFF, CAPITALISMO, MONOCULTURAS, COLONIZAÇÃO</h3>
Many have argued that the sugar plantations were central to the emergence
of modern capitalism, but Moore adds that sugar (and silver) 'were ecologically central,
constitutive moments of an epochal reorganization of "world ecology"' (Moore 2003:
309), enabling global divisions of labour. The introduction of sugar monocultures
exhausted Caribbean soils, initiating cycles of unsustainable development. Capitalism's
configuration of the nature-society dialectic - the capitalist oikeios - is founded on a
metabolic rift in the relations between humans and the earth through severing the
relation between the mass of the population and the land (Moore 2000).(OLOFF, 2012:34)

<h3>OLOFF, COLONIALISSMO, EXPLORAÇÃO</h3>
In
the context of the Caribbean, the 'chief legacies of colonialism' and, in particular,
the plantation economy, have been 'the compromised deforested environments'
(Paravisini-Gebert 2011: 100), the consequences of which are a loss of biodiversity,
soil erosion, flooding, aridification, climate change, and related signs of environmental
degradation. (OLOFF, 2012:34)

<h3>OLOFF, CAPITALISMO, EXPLORAÇÃO</h3>
The transformation and exhaustion of
the environment in the colonies was a condition for capitalist expansion (Moore 2003:
309); capitalism is fuelled by its constant drive towards natural exhaustion, which
leads to further cycles of expansion and plunder. (OLOFF, 2012:34)

<h3>OLOFF, ZUMBI, NATUREZA, EXPLORAÇÃO</h3>
The zombie disturbs the fantasy
of the modern rational and autonomous individual for whom 'nature' becomes 'mere
objectivity' (Adorno and Horkheimer 2002: 6) and for whom clearing the land was a
mark of progress in contrast to the 'wilderness' of the forests (Paravisini -Gebert 2011:
101). (OLOFF, 2012:35)

<h3>OLOFF, ZUMBI, NATUREZA</h3>
The zombie is presented as archaic, pre-modern, but I want to argue that the figure sits uneasily with this temporal narrative of evolution. '[The zombie] upsets everything; observes the narrator of The Magic Island; 'by "everything" I meant the natural fixed laws and processes on which all modern thought and actions are based' ( 1 00). The rational, autonomous subject is momentarily destabilised by the figure of the zombie that de-naturalises the assumptions on which the fantasy of the autonomous individual (who participates freely in the market and improves wild nature) is based. (OLOFF, 2012:35)

<h3>OLOFF, ZUMBI, HAITI</h3>
One may here note the context in which the zombie is introduced in the text, namely specifically in relation to the production of sugar. In the case of Haiti, sugar production had come to an end after independence, but it was resumed on a large scale during US occupation at the beginning of the twentieth century (Lundahl2002: 90); the American-owned Haitian-American Sugar Company (Hasco) began producing in 1918. (OLOFF, 2012:36)

<h3>OLOFF, ZUMBI, MODERNIDADE, CAPITALISMO</h3>
The zombies in this description are not primitive, but inextricably tied to the symbol of modernity, 'modern big business' represented by Hasco, which the narrator here seeks to tie firmly to the 'modern' world known to the American reader. Thus, in Polynice's tale of zombies, the unevenly differentiated landscape oflabour and ecology produced by capitalism takes centre stage, as he emphasizes the incongruity of the cane fields in juxtaposition with the gleaming symbol of industrial modernity, Hasco. (OLOFF, 2012:36)

<h3>OLOFF, ZUMBI, CAPITALISMO, MODERNIDADE</h3>
The zombies powerfully speak to the experience of these labourers forced into the capitalist 'free' market: 'As Joseph lined them up for registration, they still stared, vacant-eyed like cattle, and made no • reply when asked to give their names. [ ... ] They were frightened, he said, by the din and the smoke of the great factory' (Seabrook 1929: 95). The zombie, then, is not a pre-modern figure.  (OLOFF, 2012:37)

<h3>OLOFF, HAITI, ZUMBI, RACISMO</h3>
Within Haiti, the figure of the zombie contains a critique of US agri-business's penetration of the Haitian economy. Displaced into the US context of the Depression era and mass unemployment, the alienated, consciousless figure also found a ready audience and arguably acquired a meaning that went beyond the merely sensationalist-racist dimension.(OLOFF, 2012:37)

<h3>OLOFF, ZUMBI, OUTRO, IMPERIALISMO, NATUREZA</h3>
 The ecological unconscious that is inherent in all zombie figures is thus consciously addressed in relation to human forms of alterity. In other words, the link between imperial-patriarchal othering and the exploitation of nature is made explicit through the aesthetic use of the zombie (OLOFF, 2012:39)

<h3>OLOFF, ZUMBI, HAITI, ESCRAVIDÃO</h3>
The zombie is a Haitian invention testifying to, and containing within it, the memory of the first experience of industrial exploitation, magnified by the extremely brutal and dehumanizing context of slavery that reduced humans to chattel, as well as the experience of the ecological dimension of modernity, intensified by the plantations. (OLOFF, 2012:42)

<h3>OLOFF, ZUMBI, ALMA, CAPITALISMO</h3>
While the zombie was deracinated from its original context and emptied of its spiritual dimension, while it has changed dramatically over time and through its displacements (from disembodied soul, to soulless, slowmoving body, to revolutionary fighter, to cannibalistic, fast-moving and ever-hungry monster in Hollywood cinema of neoliberal times), it continues to be a figure that encodes the degradation of workers and land under capitalism. (OLOFF, 2012:42)

<h3>OLOFF, ROMERO, ZUMBI, ECOLOGIA</h3>
 It is not coincidental that in George Romero's films, what causes the dead to walk is a man-made human ecological disaster and that the perhaps most iconic scene is that of hordes of zombies senselessly walking across fields. Zombies could never be farmers, gardeners or planters, professions that would have to be founded on a long-term relation to the land. (OLOFF, 2012:42)

<h3>OLOFF, ZUMBI, REBELIÃO</h3>
 The zombie is, after all, not only a figure of disenfranchisement but also of mass rebellion and political unrest. (OLOFF, 2012:42)
