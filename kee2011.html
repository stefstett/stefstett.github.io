<h3>KEE, ZUMBIS, INFECÇÃO, CANIBALISMO</h3>
Contemporary American zombies are remarkably similar: They are born of infection, are the dead returned to life, and have a taste for human flesh. But this hasn’t always been the popular imagining of the zombie. When zombies were first introduced into U.S. culture, they were radically different. (KEE, 2011:9)

<h3>KEE, ROMERO, NOTLD, CANIBALISMO</h3>
While it is widely accepted that modern zombies were born in George Romero’s 1968 film Night of the Living Dead, discussion of the ties that bind modern zombies to their Haitian ancestors is sometimes forgotten. Yet this ignores the zombie’s cannibalistic roots. (KEE, 2011:9)

<h3>KEE, ZUMBI, MONSTRO, HAITI, FICÇÃO</h3>
The zombie is one of the few popular Hollywood monsters that come from outside Europe; rather, it arises out of stories connected to Haitian Voodoo, and early zombie fiction in the United States owes much to fears of Haiti as an independent black republic. (KEE, 2011:9)

<h3>KEE, CANIBALISMO, RAÇA, HAITI</h3>
The nineteenth- and twentieth-century cannibalistic discourse surrounding Haitian Voodoo was transformed into a racialized discourse in early zombie films, but it becomes evident that over time, as the zombie matured, the overt link to Haiti and to Voodoo dissolved so that zombies came to represent any ethnic group. (KEE, 2011:10)

<h3>KEE, HAITI, REVOLUÇÃO</h3>
Following a series of slave revolts in the 1790s, in 1804 Haiti became the first black-ruled independent nation in the Western Hemisphere. (KEE, 2011:10)

<h3>KEE, VOODOO, HAITI, REVOLUÇÃO</h3>
From nearly the beginning, external commentary painted Voodoo as central to the revolts, and merely the possibility of a connection between the revolution and Voodoo presented opponents of Haitian independence with a means to disparage revolutionary ideas by linking them to a supposedly barbaric, superstitious belief system. (KEE, 2011:10)

<h3>KEE, HAITI, REVOLUÇÃO</h3>
Most of the fears connected to Haiti centered on stories of revolutionary atrocities directed toward white peoples. As David Brion Davis reports, ‘‘In general, the Haitian Revolution reinforced the conviction that slave emancipation in any form would lead to economic ruin and to the indiscriminant massacre of white populations.’’ (KEE, 2011:10)

<h3>KEE, HAITI, COLÔNIA</h3>
There was some justification to these fears: reports indicate that Jean Jacques Dessalines, Haiti’s new emperor, did order the massacre of the whites remaining in Haiti only a few months after the nation’s declaration of independence.8 Further, while in 1789 Saint-Domingue was overwhelmingly the most important French colony in terms of trade, by the time it became Haiti and was independent, the richest colony in the world had been reduced to ruins by more than a decade of fighting—and the impact on the global economy was immense. (KEE, 2011:11)

<h3>KEE, HAITI</h3>
Thus,what little information was available about Haiti wasn’t subject to muchcritical interrogation. Much of the nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century material available in English was written by those with only a passing familiarity with the nation, or by those who wanted to use Haiti to further their own ideological causes.10 They tended to paint Haiti as either corrupt and gradually devolving or shakily trying to stand on its own. (KEE, 2011:11)

<h3>KEE, HAITI, REVOLUÇÃO </h3>
Haiti’s revolution deprived white Europeans and Americans of the ability to ‘‘civilize’’ the black world formerly known as Saint-Domingue; therefore, Haiti had to be demonized so as to create a situation where the civilizing forces of the white world could save the nation from itself. Therefore, the revolution and the nation it produced could never be seen as successful. (KEE, 2011:11)

<h3>KEE, HAITI, COLONIALISMO</h3>
Unlike other colonial holdings, however, Haiti’s ruins were not evidence of a once-great empire, but rather evidence of French colonialism left to waste. (KEE, 2011:12)

<h3>KEE, VOODOO, CANIBALISMO, HAITI</h3>
Although he never actually attended a Voodoo ceremony, relying instead on gossip and newspaper articles as sources, St. John tied it to cannibalism, human sacrifice, and grave robbing in what would become one of the most-read texts on Haiti in the nineteenth century. (KEE, 2011:12)

<h3>KEE, CANIBALISMO, HAITI, VOODOO</h3>
 Of course, inherent in St. John’s argument was the idea that cannibalism was the result of Haitian self-rule. Writings on Haitian Voodoo continued on themes of cannibalism, often claiming that Haitians ate their children in sacrifice to Voodoo gods, as many books and articles either borrowed directly from St. John or built on his assertions.15 (KEE, 2011:12)

<h3>KEE, HAITI, REVOLUÇÃO </h3>
Yet there was a practical side to concerns relating to Haitian independence as well. The revolution disrupted markets and created a massive  shortfall in the supply of tropical products like sugar and coffee. It also forced waves of refugees and migrants into neighboring countries. (KEE, 2011:13)

<h3>KEE, HAITI, </h3>
As Haiti came to represent a sort of self-destruction that could someday spill over into the rest of the Americas, the belief that Haiti had to be saved—and in its saving, contained—was prominent. Although sentiment like this may not have been the only excuse, it did play a part in the U.S. occupation of Haiti in 1915 and was most certainly an important justification for a continued presence there. (KEE, 2011:13)

<h3>KEE, ZUMBI, HAITI </h3>
Thus, as Joan Dayan notes, ‘‘it should not surprise us that during the American occupation . . . tales of cannibalism, torture, and zombies were published in [the United States]. What better way to justify the ‘civilizing’ presence of marines in Haiti than to project the phantasm of barbarism?’’1 (KEE, 2011:13)

<h3>KEE, ZUMBI, HAITI, SEABROOK</h3>
The term ‘‘zombie’’ was virtually unknown outside Haiti until 1929. At that time, though, zombies entered U.S. culture quite forcefully in William Seabrook’s book The Magic Island. Seabrook lived in Haiti and had developed a close friendship with a Voodoo priestess. In The Magic Island, he gave detailed accounts of Voodoo rituals and folklore, and one being in particular captured his interest. He wrote, ‘‘I recalled one creature I had been hearing about in Haiti, which sounded exclusively local—the zombie.’’18 Seabrook devoted a chapter of his book to the zombie. (KEE, 2011:13)

<h3>KEE, SEABROOK, ZUMBI</h3>
Seabrook continued, explaining that zombies were used as slaves by those who raised them; he then described the physical traits of zombies he had supposedly seen, who were ‘‘plodding like brutes, like automatons,’’ and whose faces were ‘‘expressionless’’ and ‘‘vacant’’ with eyes ‘‘like the eyes of a dead man, not blind, but staring, unfocused, unseeing.’’20 Seabrook’s descriptions, coupled with Alexander King’s powerful accompanying illustrations, came to codify zombie behavior in U.S. imaginations for years to come. (KEE, 2011:13-14)

<h3>KEE, ZUMBI, ESTADOS UNIDOS, CAPITALISMO</h3>
Moreover, the zombie was transplanted into the United States almost exactly as the Great Depression began. For the first time since the Civil War and emancipation, much of the United States felt dispossessed. Many Americans were made aware of just how powerless they were in the capitalist system. Identification with zombies, then, may have been particularly resonant in the 1930s United States, as zombies became an ideological critique of modernity in the form of capitalist exploitation. (KEE, 2011:14)

<h3>KEE, CINEMA, MONSTRO, ZUMBI</h3>
In film and the other arts, such individuals were often cast as delinquents, criminals, or mentally challenged. They became the monsters, so to speak. Zombies could thus also operate within a discourse that maintained whiteness as the norm and constructed those of color as monstrous. Moreover, zombies were something created outside the experience of white, middle-class America: they literally happened ‘‘over there.’’ (KEE, 2011:14)

<h3>KEE, ZUMBI, SEABROOK, METÁFORA</h3>
One of the earliest appearances of the zombie after The Magic Island was Kenneth Webb’s stage play Zombie, which opened in New York in February 1932. By all accounts, the story line of Zombie borrowed liberally from The Magic Island, and the zombies of the play were portrayed in a fashion similar to Seabrook’s descriptions. With its links to people of color, the zombie was a natural emblem for the slave, easily expendable and under the control of a powerful master. Yet, as exotic as the zombie may have been, the similarities between its plight and that of of many of these ‘‘everyday’’ Americans were not lost on observers. (KEE, 2011:14)

<h3>KEE, ZUMBI, AMEAÇA, HAITI, MULHER </h3>
Zombie had a very limited New York run and then played in Chicago. What impact it had on U.S. culture is hard to discern. Yet, in examining some of the ads for the play, one can begin to see a theme that will recur throughout early zombie fiction: a white woman is being threatened by a black figure with arms outstretched. The zombie threat to the white woman became an almost universal theme in early zombie fiction, and even as zombies moved out of Haiti, the image of the white woman endangered by a zombie would remain. (KEE, 2011:15)

<h3>KEE, ZUMBI, CINEMA, OUTRO, MULHER</h3>
Both black men and white women were imprisoned in sexual stereotypes as a means of controlling them. Thus early zombie films used the Other as a means of knowing and defining the white self, while allowing the white female to be corrupted by that Other to show exactly what harm mixing with the Other could cause. (KEE, 2011:15)
 
<h3>KEE, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO, MULHER, MISCIGENAÇÃO, FICÇÃO</h3>
Thus, without being explicit, these films managed to use the zombification of the white woman to speak to fears of miscegenation. But Zombie and the zombie fiction that would follow postulated that there was a solution to the zombie problem, that things could be returned to normal. The white male could defeat black ‘‘corruption’’; the white female could be saved. (KEE, 2011:15)

<h3>KEE, WHITE ZOMBIE, ZUMBI, MESTRE</h3>
Many of the ads for the first feature-length zombie film, White Zombie (1932), were similar to those for Zombie: A white woman reclines in peril, either from zombies or the zombie master. In many of these ads, it is the zombie master’s (sexual) desire that puts the woman in peril, and she is powerless against it. For instance, in one ad, under ominous eyes, text read, ‘‘With these zombie eyes he rendered her powerless . . . ,’’ while under hands clasped together, the text warned, ‘‘With this zombie grip he made her perform his every desire!’’ Another ad contained the tagline ‘‘She was not alive . . . nor dead . . . just a white zombie . . . performing his every desire!’’23 White slavery became an implicit undercurrent in the film’s advertising. (KEE, 2011:15-16)

<h3>KEE, MISCIGENAÇÃO, INTERRACIAL, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO, MULHER</h3>
As previously mentioned, it also spoke to fears of miscegenation. In an era when interracial coupling was still largely prohibited, or at least strongly frowned upon, there was a sense that zombification could represent the intermingling of ‘‘black’’ magic and white bodies. Finally, it implicated the female: primitivism might be associated with one’s gender. To borrow from Freud, women might really be ‘‘the dark continent.’’24 (KEE, 2011:16)

<h3>KEE, OUTRO, COLONIALISMO, CANIBALISMO, BRANCOS, WHITE ZOMBIE</h3>
Here, we see that as traditional Other-ing breaks down in one sense, a new form of Other-ing takes its place. Whereas under colonialism the boundaries between self and Other, black and white, civilized person and cannibal, seemed sharply defined,25 at this point that sharpness began to blur. In zombifying white people, in essence turning them into slaves and corrupting them with black magic, White Zombie begins to ask: How does one define the Other if the Other looks just like you or me? (KEE, 2011:16)

<h3>KEE, WHITE ZOMBIE, MULHER, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO, MISCIGENAÇÃO</h3>
In White Zombie, the female succumbs to the powers of black magic, prompting the question: What does it say about the white woman, that bastion of civilization, if she can so easily be corrupted by zombification? The idea that the white female zombie somehow represents that which is both black and white implicitly spoke to fears of miscegenation that were rather explicitly dealt with in White Zombie: When it becomes clear that Madeline, the zombified white heroine of the film, is not in her grave as her friends thought she was, Neil, her distraught fiance´, remarks, ‘‘Surely you don’t think she’s alive, in the hands of natives. Oh no! Better dead than that!’’26 Thus it is better for a white woman to be destroyed than to intermix with the ‘‘natives.’’ (KEE, 2011:16)

<h3>KEE, ZUMBIFICAÇÃO, ZUMBI, MULHER, PATRIARCADO</h3>
Of course, zombification also created a situation in which victims of a zombie master were feminized. Typically, under patriarchal systems, the female is under the power of the male—she is supposed to be ready to serve his will. (KEE, 2011:16)

<h3>KEE, ZUMBI, HOMENS</h3>
    <B>Here, we get to the very heart of zombies: They are not men.</B> (KEE, 2011:17)

<h3>KEE, ZUMBI, HUMANIDADE</h3>
In one phrase, the coachman has summarized one possible reason the zombie fascinated 1930s America: it cast an entire group of people as beings without humanity.28 (KEE, 2011:17)

<h3>KEE, OUTRO, ALTERIDADE</h3>
. It represented the ultimate Othering, casting the perceived opposite as a nonentity (KEE, 2011:17)

<h3>KEE, WHITE ZOMBIE</h3>
David Skal writes, ‘‘The shuffling spectacle of the walking dead in films like White Zombie (1932) was in many ways a nightmare vision of a breadline. . . . Millions already knew that they were no longer completely in control of their lives; the economic strings were being pulled by faceless, frightening forces.’’29 (KEE, 2011:17)

<h3>KEE, ZUMBI, COLONIZAÇÃO, ESCRAVIZAÇÃO, CAPITALISMO</h3>
Thus, while zombies seem to represent a very real fear of the return of the colonial master, they also offer a critique of both slavery and the abuse of the worker under the capitalist system. (KEE, 2011:17)

<h3>KEE, ZUMBI, FICÇÃO, VOODOO</h3>
But early zombie fiction postulated a solution to the zombie ‘‘problem.’’ In the end, the zombie master would be defeated (and his zombies with him) and the status quo restored: black Voodoo was no match for white reason. (KEE, 2011:17-18)

<h3>KEE, HALPERIN, WHITE ZOMBIE, BRANCOS</h3>
The Halperin brothers, producers of White Zombie, returned to the genre in 1936 with Revolt of the Zombies. The plot of the film centers on eliminating a zombie spell so it won’t fall into the wrong (nonwhite) hands. Things are fine as long as zombiism only affects the natives, but it is clearly not acceptable when the zombie master begins to zombify the white members of an archaeological expedition.31  (KEE, 2011:18)

<h3>KEE, VOODOO, ZUMBI, THEGHOSTBREAKERS, ESCRAVO</h3>
The next major American film to feature zombies was 1940’s The Ghost Breakers, starring Paulette Goddard and Bob Hope. This film transported Voodoo and zombies to Cuba, where Goddard’s character inherited a haunted castle guarded by ‘‘an old Negro woman with a zombie son.’’33 When Bob Hope asks a native Cuban what zombies are, the man answers: ‘‘Yes, that’s more Voodooism, and not very pleasant. When a person dies and is buried, it seems there are certain Voodoo priests who have the power to bring him back to life.’’ This is met by the exclamation, ‘‘How horrible!,’’ to which the man continues: ‘‘It’s worse than horrible because a zombie has no will of his own. You see them sometimes, walking around blindly with dead eyes. Following orders. Not knowing what they do. Not caring.’’ (KEE, 2011:19)

<h3>KEE,CONTROLE, ZUMBI </h3>
Zombies, according to this definition, don’t realize what they are doing; they are pawns in someone else’s game, and this reinforces the idea of some sort of outside control over zombies. (KEE, 2011:19)

<h3>KEE, VOODOO, ZUMBI, HAITI, ALTERIDADE, OUTRO</h3>
Here, though, with the Voodoo-zombie combination, there is the idea that a malevolent practice once used by Haitians on Haitians, then used by Haitians (or other people of color) on Haitians and white peoples, could now be used by unscrupulous groups of any race or belief system on peoples of color to work against American interests. The Other becomes split into two forms: <b>it can be the Other who holds some form of power, or the Other who is used by that power holder.</b> (KEE, 2011:19)

<h3>KEE, ZUMBI, CONTROLE, VOODOO</h3>
Conventions within the genre began to become evident. For instance, zombies were under the control of a physically locatable outside force. In the early films, this control came via a Voodoo priest or sorcerer. During the 1950s, when fears connected to burgeoning space exploration became more prevalent, zombie control was also via mad scientists or aliens. Still, zombies never acted of their own accord: there was always some sort of zombie master pulling the strings.37 (KEE, 2011:19-20)

<h3>KEE, ZUMBI, CRIATURA, CINEMA, </h3>
As Peter Dendle notes, the zombie was ‘‘one of the few screen creatures in the Hollywood menagerie not of European origin.’’39 He also observes that the zombie moved from folklore to film without much other mediation.40 In other words, there were no strong preexisting mythologies connected to the zombie in the United States—no rules or conventions with which U.S. audiences would have been familiar. (KEE, 2011:20)

<h3>KEE, ZUMBI, CINEMA</h3>
For instance, whether zombies were reanimated corpses or merely hypnotized or drugged persons varied. In some films, like Plan 9 from Outer Space (1958) or Bowery at Midnight (1942), having the dead return to life was crucial to the plot. In other films, like King of the Zombies (1941) or The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies (1964), the zombies weren’t dead but rather living people under mind control. (KEE, 2011:20)

<h3>KEE, CONTROLE, NOTLD, AUTÔMATO </h3>
Generally, however, the effects were the same: the human being lost control of his body and was directed to work for the will of another. Yet this changed in 1968 with Night of the Living Dead. The established ability to play with the rules of the zombie genre may have contributed to the radical break with the Voodoo-style zombie enacted by Night of the Living Dead, as with it, zombies moved from being automatons used as slave labor to being mindless killers. (KEE, 2011:20)

<h3>KEE, OUTRO, ALTERIDADE, CANIBAL, MONSTRO, ZUMBI</h3>
Operating within a system that assumed a knowable world and that fed on an impulse to categorize and classify, the Other was created. At first, this Other was the primitive, the savage, or the cannibal, but over time the Other became a monster. It is no coincidence that Dracula, Frankenstein’s monster, and the zombie all became popular movie monsters at roughly the same time. With each variation, American audiences could say, ‘‘I am what the Other is not.’’ Yet the zombie consistently presented the further fantasy of being tainted by the Other but then being saved. (KEE, 2011:21)

<h3>KEE, CANIBALISMO, ZUMBI, VOODOO, HAITI</h3>
Whereas cannibalism was the symbol of Haitian regression to the primitive in the United States’s pre-zombie imaginings of Haiti and Voodoo, it was contained and remained well within Haitian borders. Zombies hinted that Voodoo could corrupt those outside Haiti as well. And yet, while at one level the zombie represents a separation from the cannibal in regard to how people in the United States were thinking about Haiti, Voodoo, and the Other, the concept of cannibalism was still present in early zombie films.44 (KEE, 2011:21-22)

<h3>KEE, ZUMBI, FICÇÃO, OUTRO, ALTERIDADE</h3>
Early zombie fiction might also invite links to bell hooks’s concept of eating the Other, the one-way consumption of other cultures. hooks states, ‘‘It is by eating the Other that one asserts power and privilege,’’ and this sort of ‘‘cultural cannibalism’’ concerns power relations that grant white peoples the ability to enjoy the privilege of being able to appropriate, utilize, and borrow from other cultures without having to experience what it is actually like to be a member of another culture.45 In a sense, it is being able to try on other cultural forms at will with no real lasting effect. This is very similar to what characters were able to do in early zombie films. (KEE, 2011:22)

<h3>KEE, OUTRO, ALTERIDADE, ZUMBI, HAITI</h3>
But what constituted the Other became more and more confused as the zombie matured, leaving more and more room for skepticism as to what constituted the self. Zombies stopped being exclusively Haitian and became the province of any exotic group, but as time passed, the zombie’s explicit ties to the exotic and the Other were also weakened. Without a clearly recognized Other against which to define the self, it became that much harder to draw the line between ‘‘us’’ and ‘‘them.’’ (KEE, 2011:22)

<h3>KEE, NOTLD, CANIBALISMO, VOODOO</h3>
As zombies increasingly entered less exotic and much more mundane, white middle-class territory, their effectiveness as the new cannibals was threatened; by the time they came to reside in the rural Pennsylvania countryside with Night of the Living Dead, however, cannibalism was coupled with the zombie overtly. The cannibal, as an element of a strange religion called Voodoo, worked to separate the world into ‘‘us’’ and ‘‘them.’’ (KEE, 2011:23)

<h3>KEE, NOTLD, CANIBALISMO</h3>
Yet while conventions became flexible and abstract enough to allow the zombie to become a sort of all-purpose form for mediating a wide range of concerns, it continued to carry its past with it, and that past caught up to the zombie in 1968. With the zombies of Night of the Living Dead, cannibalism reentered the picture and could once again work to divide the world into ‘‘us’’ and ‘‘them,’’ but this time it would do so overtly tied to the form of the zombie. The zombie needed to become an obvious cannibal if it was going to continue to be put to the same kind of work. (KEE, 2011:23)
