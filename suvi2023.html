<h3>SUVI, DISCURSO AMBIENTALISTA, ESPÉCIE HUMANA, APOCALIPSE AMBIENTAL</h3>

Their ‘worst case scenario’ exemplifies those environmentalist discourses that envision catastrophic storms, droughts, and the depletion of natural resources, leading to environmental disasters, mass migration, conflict, and, eventually, the destruction of the human species. The concept of ‘environmental apocalypse’ (see, e.g., Buell 2010) denotes parallels between this discourse and the Christian biblical tradition of depict
ing the unfolding of the end times. (SUVI, 2023, p. 904)


<h3>SUVI, PENSADORES ECOLÓGICOS, MORTON, TSING, APOCALIPSE, FIM DO MUNDO</h3>

At the same time, ecological thinkers like Timothy Morton and Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing challenge and revise environmental apocalypse dis
courses. They argue that the apocalypse is already here, that we already inhabit the end of the world, and ought to explore new ways of living ‘after’ apocalypse. Such apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic forms of thought, and critiques thereof, pervade environmental politics to the extent that it has been argued that ‘what matters above all for green politics in the twenty-first century is the type of apocalypticism that becomes dominant’ (McNeish 2017, p. 1049) (SUVI, 2023, p. 904)


<h3>SUVI, PÓS-COLONIAL, RELIGIÃO, DOMINAÇÃO, APOCALIPSE AMBIENTAL</h3>

It is for this reason that this article engages with postcolonial theology, a field of thought concerned with the intersections of Christian religious thought and various systems of domination (Taylor 2004, Yountae 2018), thus far unheeded in debates on environmental apocalypse. I argue that postcolonial theology offers a critical and emancipatory account of ‘the end of the world’ that can contribute to more equal and just environmental politics. (SUVI, 2023, p. 904)


<h3>SUVI, AMBIENTALISMO, ALARMISMO, PÓS-POLÍTICA, COLONIZAÇÃO, FIM DO MUNDO</h3>

Initially the widespread portrayal of environmental issues through apoc
alyptic frames led to debates that were primarily focused on whether this depiction is alarmist and thus counter-productive (e.g. Feinberg and Willer 2011, Lilley et al. 2012, Giddens 2015) or whether it might mobilise people to take necessary political action to address environmental degradation (e.g. Thompson 2009, Buell 2010, Globus Veldman 2012). Subsequently, others have highlighted how apocalyptic imaginaries contribute to ‘post-political’ and ‘post-democratic’ governance (e.g. Swyngedouw 2010) as well as the ways in which environmental apocalypse discourses are typically based on fears of racialised others (e.g. Gergan et al. 2018) and concerns for protecting the future of whiteness (e.g. Mitchell and Chaudhury 2020). Some critics of environmental apocalypse discourses have also argued that Indigenous
ples have already gone through the end of their world several centuries ago as a consequence of colonisation and, therefore, ‘end of the world’ should be understood in the plural, as something that has already happened (e.g. Danowksi and Viveiros de Castro 2017, Davis and Todd 2017, Whyte 2018). (SUVI, 2023, p. 904)


<h3>SUVI, APOOCALIPSE AMBIENTAL, FIM DO MUNDO</h3>

The latter contributions provide important problematisations of the universalising
tendencies of ‘environmental apocalypse,’ asking critical questions
about what is expected to end and for whom. Nevertheless, Skrimshire
(2014) points out that apocalyptic discourse in environmental politics has
usually been studied with only superficial engagement with the theological
underpinnings of apocalypticism. (SUVI, 2023, p. 9055)


<h3>SUVI, APOCALIPSE AMBIENTAL</h3>

Thus, the authors engaging with the
historical and conceptual grounds of ‘environmental apocalypse’ typically
take the Western eschatological tradition as a given. ‘Apocalypse’ then refers
to ‘the cataclysmic end of the earth and human history’ as well as the
revelation of truth; the disclosure of what is ultimate in the world (Phillips
2015, p. 289). Environmental apocalypse is primarily conceived as the point
in time when the world comes to an end. Even when the literal meaning of
apocalypse as revelation and disclosure is discussed, the meaning of revelation
is primarily interpreted in relation to time. In these debates, consideration
of the last things is conducted from a temporal perspective and the
politics of environmental apocalypse is conceived predominantly as a politics
of time (see also Pellizzoni 2020). (SUVI, 2023, p. 905)


<h3>SUVI, POLÍTICA, APOCALIPSE AMBIENTAL</h3>

Hence, I problematise the political implications of this privileging of time
and interrogate the role of space in environmental apocalypse discourses. (SUVI, 2023, p. 905)


<h3>SUVI, APOCALIPSE AMBIENTAL, TEMPORALIDADE, ESPACIALIDADE</h3>

How has it
become possible to conceive of ‘environmental apocalypse’ in specifically
temporal terms? What is taken as given in such discourses and what is left
unseen by this givenness? What are the political implications of the ways in
which time and space are conceived in these discourses? (SUVI, 2023, p. 905)


<h3>SUVI, APOCALIPSE, FUTURO, MORTON, TSING</h3>

Third, I demonstrate that even critics of futural
notions of the apocalypse like Morton and Tsing remain ambiguous when
it comes to attempts to critically transcend present apocalyptic worlds. (SUVI, 2023, p. 906)


<h3>SUVI, APOCALIPSE AMBIENTAL, CRISE PERMANENTE</h3>

In contemporary perceptions, the futural sensibility of environmental
apocalypse has also become mixed with a sense of permanent crisis. Buell
(2010, p. 30) identifies a shift in the depiction of environmental apocalypse
from a ‘rush to doom’ to an ‘immersion in uncertainty and rising risk.’2 Riskmanagement
has become a way of deferring apocalypse. This shift, however,
does not fundamentally change apocalyptic discourses’ underlying futural
temporality (SUVI, 2023, p. 907)


<h3>SUVI, FIM DO MUNDO, TEMPORALIDADE</h3>

The emphasis on urgency does not directly explicate that the
world is about to end, yet it expresses a temporal device that is central to
apocalyptic discourses where processes of change accelerate as the end comes
nearer. Accordingly, Fagan (2017) identifies current environmental apocalyptic
scenarios as relating specifically to treatments of time: Time is directed
toward an event that marks a definitive end and the apocalyptic era presents
an accelerating development toward that end. The environmental apocalypse
is constituted by slowly unfolding processes which, nevertheless, accelerate
as the end gets nearer. (SUVI, 2023, p. 907)


<h3>SUVI, TEMPORALIDADE, UNIVERSALIDADE</h3>

Alongside this linear, futural temporality, a key feature of environmental
apocalypse is its planetary character. According to Figueres and Rivett-
Carnac (2020, p. 43; 73), ‘everyone understands that we are all in this
together’ because ‘we all win or lose together.’ This sentiment is shared by
Gore for whom, ‘we all live on the same planet. [. . .] We all face the same
dangers and opportunities, we share the same responsibility for charting our
course into the future’ (Gore in Meyer 2015). This emphasis on a shared
threat reflects how environmental politics shifted in the twentieth century
from addressing geographically delimited problems to focusing on climate
change as a planetary issue. Consequently, space implicitly appears as an
undifferentiated background for climate change progressing. (SUVI, 2023, p. 907)

<h3>SUVI, CLIMA GLOBAL UNIVERSAL, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA</h3>

Challenging the notion of one global climate by
asking how the climate will change from place to place would provide a more
accurate account of climate change (Stott and Thorne 2010, p. 158), and of its
differentiated social, economic, and political impacts (SUVI, 2023, p. 907)

<h3>SUVI, HUMANIDADE, APOCALIPSE</h3>

Yet, as Mitchell and
Chaudhury (2020) show, the concern with the extinction of ‘humanity’ in
apocalyptic discourses is usually a concern for the continuation of existing
power structures and (white) privileges. The spatial account of environmental
apocalypse developed in the final part of this article dispenses with the
universalism of the planetary apocalypse and interrogates the power structures
that futural conceptions of environmental apocalypse tend to obscure. (SUVI, 2023, p. 908)

<h3>SUVI, RELIGIÃO, APOCALIPSE, APOCALIPSE AMBIENTAL</h3>

The previously outlined apocalyptic discourses reproduce elements of the
Christian apocalyptic tradition, which is mainly shaped by the Book of
Revelation where the signs of the end times include famine, disease, earthquakes,
and war, and the apocalypse appears as a future catastrophic event
that leads to God’s final judgment of humanity.3 Environmental apocalypse
discourses, such as Figueres and Rivett-Carnac’s worst case scenario for
2050, depict the unfolding of catastrophe in similar ways. (SUVI, 2023, p. 908)

<h3>SUVI, AHISTÓRICO</h3>

This implies a personalistic, ahistorical view of salvation that postpones
the end to an undefined future. (SUVI, 2023, p. 908)

<h3>SUVI, ESCATOLOGIA, RELIGIÃO, HEGEL</h3>

Although eschatology – the doctrine of the last things, the final events that bring history to an end – is typically perceived as a religious mode of reasoning, its structure has travelled to modern political thought as a way of perceiving the direction and form of historical and epistemological pro
gress (Wolfe 2017). In modern eschatological thinking, the Christian
tation of a final consummation is transferred into the historical process (Löwith 1949). The end of things becomes the culmination of a historical development instead of an exit from the world. Most notably, Hegel
forms eschatological thought by making the end immanent to history. In Hegel’s (1988, p. 12; 19) work, the purpose of the world is conceived as the unfolding of reason in time, ‘in the theater of world history’, not in a realm beyond the world. This makes ‘the end’ immanent to the world while maintaining Christian eschatology’s future-oriented temporality (see also Westhelle 2012, pp. 40–41). The emphasis on temporal distinctiveness thus characterises both Christian and secularised modern eschatologies, and the secularisation of futural eschatology emerging from Hegel’s work underpins the futural logic of contemporary notions of environmental apocalypse, as examined above. (SUVI, 2023, p. 909)

<h3>SUVI, ESCATOLOGIA, ESPAÇO, HISTÓRIA</h3>

In this tradition, eschatological thinking is understood to concern the end of time, remaining rather oblivious to spatial questions. However, space is not fully absent from these accounts. For example, Lefebvre (1991, pp. 21–22) argues that in Hegelian philosophy, historical time constitutes an immobile space for the realisation of reason. Space becomes a residue of historical time. History, then, is directed at an ultimate purpose with space figuring as the homo
genous background where progress inscribes itself. (SUVI, 2023, p. 909)

<h3>SUVI, APOCALIPSE AMBIENTAL, MORTON, TSING</h3>

Futural apocalyptic environmentalism is critiqued by authors like Morton
and Tsing who are influential voices within increasingly important
approaches to environmental politics, such as new materialism, posthumanism,
and object-oriented ontology (e.g. Celermajer et al. 2021). As their book
titles demonstrate, Morton and Tsing concur on the assertion that ‘we’
already live at, or even after, the end of the world. Because the end of the
world has already happened, both denialism and apocalyptic environmentalism
have arguably become obsolete (Morton 2013, p. 2). (SUVI, 2023, p. 910)

<h3>SUVI, MORTON, HIPEROBJETOS, NÃO-LOCALIDADE</h3>

Morton (2013, p. 1) credits the end of the world to ‘hyperobjects’: ‘things
that are massively distributed in time and space relative to humans.’ His
examples of hyperobjects include plastic bags, Styrofoam, plutonium, the
Florida Everglades, the machinery of capitalism, and the Earth itself, which,
he argues, are characterised particularly by their ‘nonlocality.’ (SUVI, 2023, p. 910)

<h3>SUVI, TSING, PRECARIEDADE, PATCHY ANTHROPOCENE</h3>

Based on ethnographic research, Tsing (2015, p. 6) argues
that we are living in a ‘global state of precarity’ which we need to embrace as
a fundamental condition of existence. Yet, Tsing’s conception does not imply
an indifference to spatial particularity. Instead, she develops the concept of
the ‘patchy Anthropocene’ to draw attention to ‘uneven conditions of morethan-
human livability in landscapes increasingly dominated by industrial
forms’ (Tsing et al. 2019, p. 186), suggesting a spatially sensitive notion of
precarity at the end of the world. (SUVI, 2023, p. 911)

<h3>SUVI, TSING, MORTON, IGUALDADE ONTOLÓGICA</h3>

Consequently, both Tsing’s and Morton’s accounts of the end remain
ambiguous when it comes to how spatial differentiation is entangled with
asymmetrical power relations and how they could be challenged. In Morton,
collapsing the spatial dimension into nonlocality is an expression of ‘flat’
ontology (e.g. Bryant 2011)5 that proclaims the ontological equality of all
objects, including humans (SUVI, 2023, p. 911)

<h3>SUVI, TSIGN, CAPITALISMO, PRECARIEDADE</h3>

Tsing (2015, p. 20), in turn, explicitly proposes affirming diversity, contingency,
precarity, and surprise as challenges to capitalism, suggesting that
‘Precarious living is always an adventure.’ Yet, this arguably reproduces
a conception of life that is compatible with, indeed, promoted by the operations
of neoliberal capitalism.6 Neoliberal capitalism is based on the proliferation
and optimisation of difference (Foucault 2010, p. 259). It is
predicated on a constitutive openness to uncertainty and the accidental
(Massumi 2009, pp. 176–180). This openness is exactly what Tsing suggests
as having disruptive potential. And yet, in the contemporary political economy,
embracing precarity and the uncertainty of life risks over-emphasising
an affirmative way of relating to the status quo, thereby reinforcing rather
than challenging it (SUVI, 2023, p. 91)

<h3>SUVI, PÓS-COLONIAL, RELIGIÃO</h3>

Postcolonial theology spans various strands and fields, including postcolonial
literary criticism of biblical texts, historiographies of the spreading of
Christianity as driving empire-building and colonialism, and the reinterpretation
of Christian thought from Global South perspectives (see, e.g.,
Sugirtharajah 1991, Dube 2000, Lartey 2013). Although postcolonial theology
emerged as a disciplinary approach only in the 1990s (see Nausner 2012),
many of its ideas have existed throughout history in alternative theological
traditions (see Yountae 2018). Postcolonial theologies emphasise many early
Christian movements’ opposition to imperialism, oppression, and
exploitation.8 Postcolonial theologies revive these resistant positions and
prioritise the concerns of the marginalised and the oppressed (Taylor 2004,
p. 49). Key to this is a reading of Christian theology in ‘this world’ rather than
in the realm of the immaterial (Yountae 2018, p. 729). This shift is significant
for theology’s relationship to politics and relies largely on rethinking
eschatology. (SUVI, 2023, p. 913 )

<h3>SUVI, TEMPORALIDADE, APOCALIPSE, RELIGIÃO</h3>

He argues that, although the temporal understanding
of apocalypse is central to Christianity, the privileging of time over space is
the outcome of a particularly Western view of history rather than a biblically
grounded reading of eschatology. Based on texts of the early Church and the
New Testament, Westhelle shows that at the inception of Christianity, ‘the
end’ had various spatial connotations. ‘The end’ could refer to a specific
place, a geographical location, or the last position in a hierarchical order
(Westhelle 2012, p. 34). (SUVI, 2023, p. 913)

<h3>SUVI, ESCATOLOGIA, APOCALIPSE </h3>

When eschatology is understood in terms of a future realm at the
end of time, it may have the effect of disregarding social and historical
contexts in which apocalypse takes place. This is the case because the focus
on a single future catastrophe obscures present social antagonisms (SUVI, 2023, p. 914)

<h3>SUVI, TSING, MARGENS, WESTHELLE</h3>

Where
Tsing (1994) emphasises the creative potential of the margins, Westhelle
(2012, p. 82) conceptualises them as limits set by individuals or systems,
producing suffering and necessitating the pursuit of liberation from them.
Following Westhelle’s (2012, p. 34) reading of the New Testament, margins
and edges – the ‘ends of the earth’ – should be understood literally and
figuratively. For the purposes of this article, the literal ends of the earth are
those geographical spaces most adversely affected by environmental crises.
Yet, Westhelle (2012, p. 79) explains that the meaning of such margins and
edges is not only geographical. Instead, eschatological experience is constituted
at the margins of existing systems and powers (Westhelle 2012, p. 73).
Consequently, categories like race, gender, and class become relevant for
postcolonial eschatology. While they direct attention to processes of marginalisation
in the present, an eschatology that takes the spatial dimension
seriously cannot categorically identify a single centre that determines marginalisation.
Rather, it foregrounds the need to analytically establish the
forms of marginalisation in specific places. (SUVI, 2023, p. 914)

<h3>SUVI, PÓS-COLONIAL, ESPACIALIDADE</h3>

Reinterpreting Christian theology from postcolonial and feminist perspectives,
Keller (2005, p. 170) suggests that the particularity of a place
should not be established by separating it from other places – by solely
emphasising its ‘difference’ – but by tracing its relation to those other places.
These relations should be analysed as loci of power and domination, expressive
of the systemic effects of colonialism, sexism, and global capitalism
(Keller 2005, p. 170) (SUVI, 2023, p. 915)

<h3>SUVI, ESPACIALIDADE, ESCATOLOGIA, LUTA DE CLASSES</h3>

Spatiality is thus not understood here in the narrow
sense of territoriality, but in terms of, for example, social location, race,
gender, and class. Central to postcolonial theology is the recognition that,
for example, for displaced peoples, transcendence is a matter of places –
fences and walls – and the means by which structures of power like capital
and the state keep them out of specific places, rather than a matter of a new
time to come (Keller 2005, p. 171). Thus, eschatology is concerned with that
which differently affects lived realities (Westhelle 2012, p. 138), since location
in space is usually attached to some degree of advantage and disadvantage
(Soja 2010, p. 73). Thinking apocalypse in these terms means attending to
economic inequality, class struggle, racial conflicts, means of production, and
their relation to the earth that constitutes their place (Carvalhaes 2019,
p. 462). Addressing environmental apocalypse in terms of the limits and
edges entails challenging spatially specific manifestations of such generalised
relations of oppression in their intersection with environmental politics. (SUVI, 2023, p. 915)

<h3>SUVI, PÓS-COLONIAL, ESCATOLOGIA </h3>

Postcolonial
theology shows that the separation of time and space and the privileging of
the former detaches the idea of transformation from concrete historical
existence. Instead, postcolonial eschatologies think space and time in more
emancipatory ways. Consequently, what I call ‘postcolonial environmental
eschatology’ directs attention to issues of power, geographical, and material
inequality in engagements with climate change or environmental degradation.
This means prioritising the socially, politically, and economically differentiated
spaces where the environmental apocalypse takes place and
analysing their intertwinement with structures of oppression to enable
transformative practices aiming to move beyond them (SUVI, 2023, p. 915)

<h3>SUVI, APOCALIPSE AMBIENTAL, FUTURO </h3>

The conception of environmental apocalypse as a futural and planetary
phenomenon – prominently expressed in sources such as Figueres and
Rivett-Carnac’s The Future We Choose – reproduces the prioritisation of
time over spatial differentiation that has been typical of Christian theology
and modern, Western understandings of history. Such futural apocalyptic
discourses may be interpreted as expressions of what Dupuy (2012) calls
‘enlightened doomsaying,’ which aims ‘to raise awareness and spur action’ to
avert catastrophe. For Dupuy (2012), the political purpose of focusing on the
future is to produce ‘an image of the future sufficiently catastrophic to be
repulsive and sufficiently credible to trigger the actions that would block its
realization.’ The aims of Figueres and Rivett-Carnac and others who deploy
environmental apocalypse discourses may be similar to this. Yet, regardless
of the possible intentions behind such discursive mobilisations, I have argued
that the futural and planetary notion of environmental apocalypse entails
disregarding existing political and socio-economic inequality and conflict.
Consequently, the futural formulation of environmental apocalypse risks
producing environmental politics that sidelines their role in addressing
environmental problems. (SUVI, 2023, p. 916)

<h3>SUVI, ESPACIALIDADE, PÓS-COLONIAL, FIM DO MUNDO</h3>

To emphasise the
spatial dimension, I have begun to chart the contribution of postcolonial
theology to the field of environmental political thought and shown that an
alternative environmental eschatology opens up when apocalypse is understood
spatially. Consequently, ‘the end’ is variably distributed across geographical,
social, and material divides. Recovering the lost dimension of
environmental apocalypse entails putting these divides at the centre of
examination. In this regard, postcolonial environmental eschatology resonates
with those decolonial and Indigenous critiques of the Anthropocene
that call for more pluralist understandings of the world and its ends (e.g.
Davis and Todd 2017, Mitchell and Chaudhury 2020). (SUVI, 2023, p. 916)
