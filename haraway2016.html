            <h3>HARAWAY, INDIVIDUALISMO</h3>
            
            What happens when human expectionalism and bounded individualism, those old saws of Western philosophy and political economics, become unthinkable in the best sciences, whether natural or social? Seriously unthinkable: not available to think with (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 30)
            
            <h3>HARAWAY, FRASE DE EFEITO</h3>
            
            Nobody lives everywhere; everybody lives somewhere. Nothing is connected to everything; everything is connected to something (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 31)
            
            <h3>HARAWAY, PENSAMENTO TENTACULAR</h3>
            
            The tentacular ones tangle me in SF. Their many appendages make string figures; they entwine me in the poiesis - the making - of speculative figures, science fiction, science fact, speculative feminism, <i>soin de ficelle</i>, so far (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 31)
            
            <h3>HARAWAY, SIMPOEISE</h3>
            
            The earth of the ongoing Chthulucene is sympoietic, not autopoietic. Mortal Worlds (Terra, Earth, Gaia, Chthulu, the myriad names and powers that are not Greek, Latin, or Indo-European at all) do not make themselves, no matter how complex and multileveled the systems, no matter how much order out of disorder might be produced in generative autopoietic system breakdowns and relaunchings at higher levels of order (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 33)
            
            <h3>HARAWAY, SIMPOIESE </h3>
            
            M. Beth Dempster's Marter of Environmental Studies thesis written in 1998, in which she suggested the term <i>sympoiesis</i> for "collectively-produceing systems that do not have self-defined spatial or temporal boundaries. Information and control are distributed among components. The systems are evolutionary and have the potential por surprising change". By contrast, autopoietic systems are "self-producing" autonomous units "with self defined spatial or temporal boundaries that tend to be centrally controlled, homeostatic and predictable (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 33)
            
            <h3>HARAWAY, INDIVIDUALISMO, </h3>
            
            Bounded (or neoliberal) individualism amended by autopoiesis is not good enough figurally or scientifically; it misleads us down deadly paths (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 33)
            
            <h3>HARAWAY, FRASE DE EFEITO</h3>
            
            "It matters what ideas we use to think other ideas" (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 34)
            
            <h3>HARAWAY, ANTROPOCENO</h3>
            
            These times called the Anthropocene are times of multispecies, including human, urgency: of great mass death and extinction; of onrushing disasters, whose unpredictable specificities are foolishly taken as unknowability itself; of refusing to be present in and to unrushing catasthophe in time; of unprecedented looking away (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 35)
            
            <h3>HARAWAY, URGÊNCIA, APOCALIPSE</h3>
            
            How can we think in times of urgencies <i>without</i> the self-indulgent and self-fulfilling myths of apocalypse, when every fiber of our being is interlaced, even complicit, in the webs of processes that must somehow be engaged and repatterned? Recursively, whether we asked for it or not, the pattern is in our hands. The answer to the trust of the held-out hand: think we must (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 35-36)
            
            <h3>HARAWAY, TSING, URGÊNCIA, EMERGÊNCIA </h3>
            
            She [n.a. Tsing] performs thinking of a kind that must be cultivated in the all-too-ordinary urgencies of onrushing multispecies extinctions, genocides, immiserations, and exterminations. I name these thing urgencies rather than emergencies because the latter word connotes something approaching apocalypse and its mythologies (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 37)
            
            <h3>HARAWAY, TSING </h3>
            
            Driven by radical curiosity, Tsing does the ethnography of "salvage accumulation" and "patchy capitalism", the kind that can no longer promise progress but can and does extend devastation and make precarity the name of our systematicity. There is no simple ethical, political, or theoretical point to take from Tsing's work; there is instead the force of engaging the world in the kind of thinking practices impossible for Eichmann's heirs (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 37)
            
            <h3>HARAWAY, LATOUR</h3>
            
            Latour is determined to avoid the idols of a ready-to-hand fix, such as Laws of History, Modernity, the State, God, Progress, Reason, Decadence, Nature, Technology, or Science, as well as the debilitating disrespect for difference and shared finitude inherent in those who already know the answers toward those who only need to learn them - by force, faith, or self-certain pedagogy. Those who "believe" they have the answers to the present urgencies are terribly dangerous (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 41)
            
            <h3>HARAWAY, LATOUR</h3>
            
            Latour makes clear that he does not <i>want</i> this story, but he does not propose another. The only real possibility for peace lies in the tale of the respected enemy, the <i>hostis</i>, and the trials of strength. "But when you are at war, it is only through the throes of the encounters that the authority you have or don't have will be decided <i>depending whether you win or lose</i>(HARAWAY, 2016, p. 43)
            
            <h3>HARAWAY, GAIA, SEXTA GRANDE EXTINÇÃO</h3>
            
            Earth/Gaia is maker and destroyer, not resource to be exploited or ward to be protected or nursing mother promising nourishment. Gaia is not a person but complex systemic phenomena that compose a living planet. Gaia's intrusing into our affairs is a radically materialist event that collects up multitudes. This intrusion threatens not life on earth itself - microbes will adapt, to put it mildly - but threatens the livability of earth for a vast kinds, species, assemblages, and individuals in an "event" already under way called the Sixth Great Extinction (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 43)
            
             <h3>HARAWAY, ANTROPOCENO, GLOBALIZAÇÃO, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA</h3>
            
            But for now, notice that the Anthropocene obtained purchase in popular and scientific discourse in the context of ubiquitous urgent efforts to find ways of talking about, theorizing, modeling, and managing a Big Thing called Globalization. Climate-change modeling is a powerful positive feedback loop provoking change-of-state in systems of political and ecological discourses  (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 45)
            
             <h3>HARAWAY, PIGNARRE & STENGERS</h3>
            
            Pignarre and Stengers affirm on-the-ground collectives capable of inventing new practices of imagination, resistance, revolt, repair, and mourning, and of living and dying well. They remind us that the established disorder is not necessary; another world is not only urgently needed, it is possible, but not if we are ensorcelled in despair, cynicism, or optimism, and the belief/disbelief discourse of Progress (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 51)
            
             <h3>HARAWAY, GAIA, INTRUSÃO</h3>
            
            Arising from Chaos, Gais was and is a powerful intrusive force, in no one's pocket, no one's hope for salvation, capable of provoking the late twentieth century's best autopoietic complex systems thinking that led to recognizing the devastation caused by anthropogenic processes of the last few centuries, a necessary counter to the Euclidean figures and stories of Man (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 51-52)
            
             <h3>HARAWAY, TSING, ANTROPOCENO</h3>
            
            Anna Tsing in a recent paper called "Feral Biologies" suggests that the inflection point between the Holocene and the Anthropocene might be the wiping out of most of the refugia from which diverse species assemblages (with or without people) can be reconstituted after major events (like desertification, or clear cutting, or, or,...) (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 100)
            
             <h3>HARAWAY, ANTROPOCENO</h3>
            
            Perhaps the outrage meriting a name like the Anthropocene is about the destruction of places and times of refuge for people and other critters (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 100)
            
             <h3>HARAWAY, HISTÓRIAS</h3>
            
            All the thousand names are too big and too small; all the stories are too big and too small. As Jim Clifford taught me, we need stories (and theories) that are just big enough to gather up the complexities and keep the edges open and greedy for surprising new and old connections (HARAWAY, 2016, p. 101)
            
             <h3>HARAWAY, METÁFORA</h3>
            
            Bacteria and fungi abound to give us metaphors; but, metaphors aside (good luck with that!), we have a mammalian job to do, with our biotic and abiotic sympoietic collaborators, colaborers. We need to make kin symchthonically, sympoetically. Who and whatever we are, we need to make-with - become-with, compose-with - the earth-bound (thanks for that term, Bruno Latour-in-Anglophone-mode) (HARAWAY, 2016, p. )  .
