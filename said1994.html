<h3>SAID, FICÇÃO, IMPERIALISMO</h3>
 Since my exclusive focus here is on the modem Western empires of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, I have looked especially at cultural forms like the novel, which I believe were immensely important in the formation ofimperial attitudes, references,
and experiences. (SAID, 1994:xii)

<h3>SAID, FICÇÃO, HISTÓRIA, IMPÉRIO</h3>
A great deal of recent criticism has concentrated on narrative fiction, yet very little attention has been paid to· its position in the history and world of empire. (SAID, 1994:xii)

<h3>SAID, FICÇÃO, COLONIALISMO, </h3>
Readers of this book will quickly discover that narrative is crucial to my argument here, my basic point being that stories are at the heart of what explorers and novelists say about strange regions of the world; they also become the method colonized people use to assert their own identity and the existence of their own history.(SAID, 1994:xii) 

<h3>SAID, COLONIALISMO, FICÇÃO, </h3>
As one critic has suggested, nations themselves are narrations. The power to narrate, or to block other narratives from forming and emerging, is very important to culture and imperialism, and constitutes one of the main connections between them. Most important, the grand narratives of emancipation and enlightenment mobilized people in the colonial world to rise up and throw off imperial subjection; in the process, many Europeans and Americans were also stirred by these stories and their protagonists, and they too fought for new narratives of equality and human community. (SAID, 1994:xii)
