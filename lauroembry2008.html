 <h2>LAURO & EMBRY, 2008</h2>

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, METÁFORA</h3>
  The  zombie has  become  a  scientific  concept  by  which  we  define  cognitive  processes and  states  of  being,  subverted  animation,  and  dormant  consciousness.  In neuroscience,  there  are  “zombie  agents”;  in  computer  science  there  are “zombie  functions.”  We  even  find  “zombie  dogs,”  “zombie  corporations,” and  “zombie  raves”  in  the  news.  The  ubiquity  of  the  metaphor  suggests the  zombie’s  continued  cultural  currency,  and  we  will  investigate  why  this specter  has  captured  the  American  imagination  for  over  a  century. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:85-86)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, CAPITALISMO</h3>
  We  want to  take  a  deeper  look  at  the  zombie  in  order  to  suggest  its  usefulness  as  an ontic/hauntic  object  that  speaks  to  some  of  the  most  puzzling  elements  of our  sociohistorical  moment,  wherein  many  are  trying  to  ascertain  what  lies in store for humanity  after global capitalism—if anything. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:86)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, HAITI, HEGEL, DIALÉTICA, MORTO-VIVO, PÓS-HUMANO</h3>
This  is  an  essay  full  of  zombies—the  historical,  folkloric  zombie  of  Haitian origin,  which  reveals  much  about  the  subject  position  and  its  relationship  to a  Master/Slave  dialectic;  the  living-dead  zombie  of  contemporary  film,  who seems  increasingly  to  be  lurching  off  the  screen  and  into  our  real  world  (as a  metaphor,  this  zombie  reveals  much  about  the  way  we  code  inferior  subjects  as  unworthy  of  life);  and  finally,  we  are  putting  forth  a  zombie  that  does not  yet  exist:  a  thought-experiment  that  exposes  the  limits  of  posthuman theory  and  shows  that  we  can  get  posthuman  only  at  the  death  of  the  subject. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:86-87)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, HARAWAY, CIBORGUE, ZUMBI, DIALÉTICA, PÓS-HUMANO, ANTISUJEITO.</h3>
  Unlike  Donna  Haraway’s  “Cyborg  Manifesto,”  we  do  not  propose  that the  position  of  the  zombie  is  a  liberating  one—indeed,  in  its  history,  and  in its  metaphors,  the  zombie  is  most  often  a  slave.  However,  our  intention  is  to illustrate  that  the  zombie’s  irreconcilable  body  (both  living  and  dead)  raises the  insufficiency  of  the  dialectical  model  (subject/object)  and  suggests,  with its  own  negative  dialectic,  that  the  only  way  to  truly  get  posthuman  is  to become antisubject. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:87)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI</h3>
   The  book also  may  come  close  to  revealing  what  it  is  about  the  zombie  that  captivates  the  human  imagination:  “Conventional  warfare  is  useless  against these  creatures,  as  is  conventional  thought.  The  science  of  ending  life, developed  and  perfected  since  the  beginning  of  our  existence,  cannot  protect  us  from  an  enemy  that  has  no  ‘life’  to  end.” (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:88)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, MONSTRO</h3>
Why  does  the  zombie  terrify,  and  what  explains  the  enduring  currency  of  the  zombie  threat?  Is  it  merely  that  the  zombie  mocks  our  mortality, and  if  so,  is  the  fear  it  inspires  different  from  that  of  other  immortal  monsters,  like  the  vampire? (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:88)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, ANTISUJEITO, MONSTRO, </h3>
Nowhere  is this  drama  more  acutely  embodied  than  in  the  model  of  the  zombie  attack: for  the  zombie  is  an  antisubject,  and  the  zombie  horde  is  a  swarm  where no  trace  of  the  individual  remains.  Therefore,  unlike  the  vampire,  the  zombie  poses  a  twofold  terror:  There  is  the  primary  fear  of  being  devoured  by a  zombie,  a  threat  posed  mainly  to  the  physical  body,  and  the  secondary fear  that  one  will,  in  losing  one’s  consciousness,  become  a  part  of  the  monstrous  horde.  Both  of  these  fears  reflect  recognition  of  one’s  own  mortality and  ulti mately  reveal  the  primal  fear  of  losing  the  “self”;  however,  in  the figure  of  the  zombie,  the  body  and  the  mind  are  separated  antinomies. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:89)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, MONSTRO, ZUMBI </h3>
 Whereas  the vampire  and  even  the  intangible  ghost  retain  their  mental  faculties,  and  the werewolf  may  become  irrational,  bestial  only  part  of  time,  only  the  zombie has  completely  lost  its  mind,  becoming  a  blank—animate,  but  wholly  devoid of consciousness. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:89)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, HUMANO</h3>
  As  unconscious  but  animate  flesh,  the  zombie  emphasizes  that  humanity  is  defined by  its  cognizance. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:89)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, HUMANO, SUBHUMANO, ESCRAVO</h3>
  Humanity defines  itself  by  its  individual  consciousness  and  its  personal  agency:  to  be a  body  without  a  mind  is  to  be  subhuman,  animal;  to  be  a  human  without agency  is  to  be  a  prisoner,  a  slave.  The  zombi(i)/e  is  both  of  these,  and  the zombi(i)/e (fore)tells our past, present, and future. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:89)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, CORPO, ESCRAVO, ZUMBI</h3>
As  Plato  wrote,  “the  body  is  the  tomb  of  the  soul.”  Just  as  the slave’s  own  body  becomes  his  prison,  the  zombie  illustrates  humanity’s inherent  imprisonment,  if  by  counterpoint.  The  zombie  shows  us  what  we are:  irrevocably  bound  to  our  bodies  and  already  married  to  the  grave. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:90)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, METÁFORA, HAITI, ESCRAVO, HUMANO, </h3>
  As  such, the  zombie  metaphor  (like  its  mythological  parent,  the  Haitian  zombi)  is  not purely  a  slave  but  is  also  slave  rebellion.  While  the  human  is  incarcerated in  mortal  flesh,  the  zombie  presents  a  grotesque  image  that  resists  this confinement—animating  his  body  even  beyond  death.  At  the  same  time that  the  zombie  emphasizes  human  embodiment,  he  also  defies  the  very limits  that  he  sets. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:90)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, DIALÉTICA, ZUMBI, MORTO-VIVO,</h3>
  What  underlies  this  symbolic  duality,  however,  is  that the  zombie,  neither  mortal  nor  conscious,  is  a  boundary  figure.  Its  threat  to stable  subject  and  object  positions,  through  the  simultaneous  occupation  of a  body  that  is  both  living  and  dead,  creates  a  dilemma  for  power  relations and  risks  destroying  social  dynamics  that  have  remained—although  widely questioned,  critiqued,  and  debated—largely  unchallenged  in  the  current economic superstructure. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:90)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, HARAWAY, PÓS-HUMANO, DIALÉTICA</h3>
We  attempt  to  read  the  zombie  as  a  more  effective  imagining  of posthumanism  than  the  cyborg  because  of  its  indebtedness  to  narratives  of historical  power  and  oppression,  and  we  stress  the  zombie’s  relevance  as a  theoretical  model  that,  like  the  cyborg,  crashes  borders.  Simultaneously living  and  dead,  subject  and  object,  slave  and  slave  rebellion,  the  zombie presents  a  posthuman  specter  informed  by  the  (negative)  dialectic  of  power relations  rather  than  gender. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:91)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, HARAWAY, CIBORGUE, PÓS-HUMANO, ZUMBI, DESTRUIÇÃO</h3>
Borrowing  the  title  and  the  spirit  of  Haraway’s  “Cyborg  Manifesto,” one  of  the  inaugurating  texts  of  “posthuman  theory,”  we  argue  here  that  the zombie  can  be  made  to  speak  only  as  a  somewhat  ironic  discursive  model. The  zombie  is  anticatharsis;  thus,  “a  zombie  manifesto”  is  one  that  cannot  call  for  positive  change,  it  calls  only  for  the  destruction  of  the  reigning model. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:91)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, HARAWAY, CIBORGUE, ZUMBI, COLONIALISMO</h3>
That  said,  we  do  feel  that  the  zombii  solves  several  problems  that the  cyborg  model  failed  to  adequately  address:  specifically,  we  read  the zombie  with  and  against  humanist  philosophy  and  psychoanalysis,  but  we also  discuss  the  historical  significance  of  the  zombie  as  boundary  marker and  read  it  in  the  context  of  a  Marxist  theory  of  power  dynamics,  colonialism,  and  industry. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:91)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, HUMANO, PÓS-HUMANO, CAPITALISMO, </h3>
As  a  figure  defined  by  its  liminality,  the  zombii  illustrates  our  doubts about  humanity  in  an  era  in  which  the  human  condition  may  be  experiencing  a  crisis  of  conscience  as  well  as  a  crisis  of  consciousness.  We  will present  the  zombii  as  a  model  of  posthuman  consciousness  (one  that  is postcyborg)  in  dispute  with  the  capitalist  era’s  homo-laborans,  as  well  as a  body  that  speaks  to  the  psyche’s  fears  of  dissolution;  the  zombii  is  both an  effective  model  for  imagining  the  condition  of  posthumanity  and,  quite literally,  a  post(mortem)  human. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:91-92)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, CAPITALISMO</h3>
Filmmakers  and  critics  have  noted  the  resonance  of  the  zombie  with the  factory  worker’s  mechanistic  performance,  the  brain-dead,  ideologyfed  servant  of  industry,  and  the  ever-yawning  mouth  of  the  nation-state. The  individual  under  capitalism  is  often  characterized  as  a  zombie.(LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:92)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, ADORNO</h3>
  But  as Max  Horkheimer  and  Theodor  Adorno  write,  our  zombie  individuality  is  one that  relies  on  the  illusion  of  self:  Under  such  a  system,  “nothing  is  left  of him  but  that  eternally  same  I  think  that  must  accompany  all  ideas. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:92)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, INDIVIDUALISMO, ZUMBI, CAPITALISMO</h3>
  What  Horkheimer  and  Adorno and  others  illustrate  is  that  the  illusory  separation  of  subject  and  object, the  fata  morgana  of  individualism,  keeps  happy  the  camp  of  zombies—the slaves  to  capitalism  who  are  merely  deluded  into  thinking  that  they  are free.  Horkheimer  and  Adorno  claim  that  subject  and  object  are  rendered (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:92)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, CAPITALISMO, BOB ESPONJA</h3>
  This  trope (n.a. Zumbi como metáfora para o proletariado) is  so  common  that  even  an  episode  of  the  children’s  show  SpongeBob SquarePants overtly draws this  connection,  when  a  character  thought  to  be  a  zombie  takes his  rightful  place  behind  a  cash  register.  See  “Once  Bitten,”  SpongeBob  SquarePants, written  by  Casey  Alexander,  Chris  Mitchell,  and  Steven  Banks,  season  4,  episode  73b, September 29, 2006. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:92)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, ESCRAVO, CAPITALISMO, PÓS-HUMANO</h3>
  But  identifying  this  conflation is  not  enough—in  the  figure  of  zombie,  subject  and  object  are  obliterated. This  figure,  simultaneously  slave  and  slave  rebellion,  is  a  more  appropriate reflection  of  our  capitalist  moment,  and  even  if  it  holds  less  promise  than a  cyborg  future,  its  prophesy  of  the  posthuman  is  more  likely  to  come  to fruition. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:93)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, REIFICAÇÃO, ZUMBI, MARX</h3>
  For  Marx,  the  efficiency  of  large-scale  industry  relies  on  the  division  of  labor  that  is  accomplished  “by  converting  the worker  into  a  living  appendage  of  the  machine.”0  Thus,  reified  as  a  part  of the  process  of  production,  the  subject  has  already  bled  into  the  object:  we are already  dwelling in the zombie’s interzone. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:93)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ADORNO, </h3>
  In Dialectic  of  Enlightenment,  Horkheimer  and  Adorno  show  that  subjectivity remains  but  a  fiction  that  allows  for  ideological  control.  They  write,  “Subjectivity  has  volatized  itself  into  the  logic  of  supposedly  optional  rules,  to  gain more  absolute  control.  Positivism,  which  finally  did  not  shrink  from  laying hands  on  the  idlest  fancy  of  all,  thought  itself,  eliminated  the  last  intervening  agency  between  individual  action  and  the  social  norm.” (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:93)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, DIALÉTICA, ADORNO, </h3>
Adorno’s  model  of  negative  dialectics  is  preferred,  “since  reason  itself  has become  merely  an  aid  to  the  all-encompassing  economic  apparatus.” For  us,  the  zombii  is  an  enactment  of  negative  dialectics.  The  living dead,  which  cannot  be  divided  into  parts  constitutive  of  the  categories  it bridges,  raises  the  insufficiency  of  the  dialectical  model.  The  kind  of  dialectic  the  zombii  incarnates  is  not  one  that  strives  for  resolution;  indeed,  it cannot,  for  as  we’ve  said,  the  zombie,  by  its  very  definition,  is  anticatharsis, antiresolution:  it  proposes  no  third  term  reconciling  the  subject/object  split, the  lacuna  between  life  and  death. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:93-44)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, DIALÉTICA, CIBORGUE, DELEUZE, ZUMBI</h3>
  The  zombii’s  lack  of  consciousness  does  not  make  it  pure  object but  rather  opens  up  the  possibility  of  a  negation  of  the  subject/object  divide. It  is  not,  like  the  cyborg,  a  hybrid,  nor  is  it  like  Gilles  Deleuze  and  Félix Guattari’s  schizophrenic,  a  multiplicity;  rather,  the  zombii  is  a  paradox  that disrupts the entire system. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:94)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, PÓS-HUMANO, HARAWAY, </h3>
  A  subject  that  is  truly  posthumanist  would  be  a  subject  that  is  not  a  subject.  Haraway’s  “Cyborg  Manifesto”  sought  to  resolve  the  antagonism  between  subject  and  object  binary  by  reimagining  the  chasm  between  the  two  through the  hybrid.  In  the  end,  however,  the  text  seems  to  propose  that  the  subject  itself  can  dissolve  the  boundary  between  subject  and  object  through  a process  of  inclusion. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:94)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, PÓS-HUMANO, CIBORGUE</h3>
  N.  Katherine  Hayles  complicated  the  model of  the  cyborg  with  her  argument  that  the  posthuman  had  lost  its  body  but kept  its  identification  with  the  Enlightenment  position  of  the  liberal  humanist  subject.  Thus,  the  cyborg  does  not  really  undo  the  subject  position  as much  as  it  just  cloaks  it  in  high-tech  window  dressing. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:94)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, DIALÉTICA, ZUMBI, </h3>
   In  contrast,  the  zombii  does  not  reconcile subject  and  object,  but,  rather,  as  walking  antithesis,  holds  them  as  irrevocably  separate;  in  the  figure  of  the  zombii,  the  subject  position  is  nullified, not reinvigorated. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:95)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, PÓS-HUMANO, ZUMBI</h3>
  We  avoid  making  the  zombii  a  “metaphor”  for  posthumanism,  for  a  metaphor  implies  equivalence;  the  analogy  connotes  only unspecified  ratio,  and  thus,  just  as  the  “zombii”  manifesto  is  one  which  cannot  advocate  a  new  model,  the  zombii  analogy  functions  negatively  to  suggest  only  the  form,  not  the  substance,  of  the  figural  relationship  between humanity  and its antitheses. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:95)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, DIALÉTICA, CIBORGUE, HUMANO </h3>
 The  zombie  metaphor  itself  goes  beyond  the  hybrid by  virtue  of  its  inseparability  into  distinct  terms.  It  is  itself  an  incarnation  of presence-absence,  yet  it  complicates  the  subject/object  position  because it  is  the  livingdead.  What  we  learned  from  the  cyborg  is  that  it  is  not  enough to  negate  the  model  “either/or”  by  claiming  “both/and.”  The  zombii  doesn’t merely  do  this—in  functioning  as  analogy,  it  replaces  any  preposition  that could  articulate  the  relation  of  zombii  to  human;  there  is  no  term  joining subject  and  object.  The  body  of  the  zombii  is  itself  this  indeterminable boundary. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:95)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, PÓS-HUMANO, CAPITALISMO, DISTOPIA</h3>
  The  zombii  thus  suggests  how  we  might  truly  move  posthuman:  the individual  must  be  destroyed.  With  this  rupture,  we  would  undo  the  repressive  forces  of  capitalist  servitude.  But  at  what  cost?  The  zombii’s  dystopic promise  is  that  it  can  only  assure  the  destruction  of  a  corrupt  system  without imagining a replacement—for the zombii can offer no resolution. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:95)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, CAPITALISM, HAITI, COLONIALISMO</h3>
The  zombie  is  historically  tied  to,  and  has  been  read  alongside,  the expansion  of  global  capitalism.  The  zombie  is  a  colonial  import:  it  infiltrated  the  American  cultural  imagination  in  the  early  twentieth  century,  at the  time  of  the  U.S.  occupation  of  Haiti.  We  cannot  take  up  the  figure  of the  zombie  without  acknowledging  its  appropriation  from  Haitian  folklore. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:96)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, HAITI, ZUMBI, HORROR, MONSTRO, ESCRAVO</h3>
Indeed, though the Haitian zombi has been “cannibalized” by  Western film and  horror  mythology,  and  though  the  zombie  can  therefore  be  read  as  a racist  denigration  of  a  “savage”  people,  there  is  also  so  much  said  by  the power  implicit  in  this  monster’s  history;  the  zombie  narrative  is,  in  some ways,  a  reprisal  of  the  Haitian  Revolution  and  a  story  of  slave  rebellion. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:96)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI,  </h3>
 Similarly,  the  zombi/e  seems  to  embody  this  kind of  disappointment:  it  only  symbolically  defies  mortality,  and  woefully  at  that: even  the  zombie’s  survival  of  death  is  anticelebratory,  for  it  remains  trapped in a corpse body. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:97)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, CAPITALISMO, IMPERIALISMO, ESCRAVO, COLONIALISMO</h3>
We  might  read  the  revision  of  the  zombie  qua  capitalist  as  yet another  imperialist  act—one  that  dispels  the  dark  fury  of  the  slave  and,  in turning  the  iconography  inside  out,  makes  the  zombie’s  insatiable  hunger figure  the  white  consumer  instead,  effectively  swallowing  the  slave  body  as the  icon  is  reappropriated.  On  some  level,  this  narrativizing  recuperates  the insurmountable  power  of  the  zombie  so  that  it  allegorizes  the  imperial,  the colonial, the capitalist structure, rather than the lowly black body. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:97)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, HAITI, </h3>
  However,  in  contemporary incarnations,  the  zombie  has  a  fluid  body  that  transgresses  its  borders  by infecting  those  it  bites;  the  Haitian  zombi  could  only  be  created  by  a  nonzombi.  Thus,  in  its  articulation  of  Western  fears  of  the  infectious  spirit  of rebellion,  this  trend  manifests  itself  in  the  cinematic  zombie  in  a  metaphor of ubiquitous contagion. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:97)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, ESCRAVO, MONSTRO</h3>
Cohen*  notes  that  zombis  were  believed  to  be  created, raised  from  the  dead,  by  a  hungan,  a  witch  doctor,  so  that  they  could  work in  the  fields  at  night.  That  the  zombie  myth  is  deeply  connected  with slavery  is  obvious,  though  critics  have  proffered  different  readings  of  the significance  of  the  monster’s  origins. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:98)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, HUXLEY, ZUMBI, ESCRAVO</h3>
  One  anthropologist,  Francis  Huxley, claims  that  the  zombi  is  an  expression  of  the  population’s  endurance  of slavery.  Cohen  writes,  “Others  have  speculated  that  the  zombie  is  sort of  a  slave’s  nightmare.  For  the  slave  the  only  hope  of  release  was  death and  the  possible  promise  of  a  blissful  afterlife.  But  if  a  dead  slave’s  body was  reanimated  for  labor  as  a  zombie,  then  the  slave  existence  would  continue  even  after  death,  a  particularly  horrible  thought. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:98)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, ESCRAVO</h3>
The  zombie  is  currently  understood  as  simultaneously  powerless and  powerful,  slave  and  slave  rebellion;  this  is  central  to  our  understanding  of  it  as  a  boundary  figure.  The  dual  potential  of  the  zombi  to  represent both  slave  and  slave  rebellion  is  key  to  its  capture  of  the  Western  imagination.  In  acknowledging  its  appropriation—and  potential  misappropriation for  ideological  purposes—we  must  not  disconnect  the  zombie  from  its  past. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:98)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, CAPITALISMO, ESCRAVO, </h3>
 As  a  nonconscious,  consuming  machine,  the  cinematic  zombie  terrifies  because  it  is  a  reflection  of  modern-day  commercial  society,  propelled only  by  its  need  to  perpetually  consume.  In  this  fairly  common  interpretation of  the  zombie  as  capitalist  icon,  the  monstrous  figure  of  global  capitalism  is fed  on  the  labors  of  the  impoverished,  “third  world”  labor  force.  The  zombie has  thus  transitioned  from  a  representation  of  the  laboring,  enslaved  colonial  body,  to  a  dual  image  of  capitalist  enslavement:  the  zombie  now  represents  the  new  slave,  the  capitalist  worker,  but  also  the  consumer,  trapped within  the  ideological  construct  that  assures  the  survival  of  the  system. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:99)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, HAITI, ZUMBI, IMPERIALISMO</h3>
  Despite  the  Haitian  zombi’s  roots  as  imperial  slave,  the  Hollywood zombie of today  does not produce anything except more zombies. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:99)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, CONSUMO, </h3>
In  its  frenzied  state  of  pure  consumption,  the zombie  seeks  to  infect  those  who  do  not  yet  share  in  the  oppression  of their  state:  the  zombie  does  not  attack  other  zombies.  It  seeks  to  transfer its  burden,  but  the  result  is  only  a  multiplication  of  its  condition:  no  zombie  body  is  relieved  of  its  condition  by  passing  it  on. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:100)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, </h3>
This  danger  is  evident  in  the  figure  of  the  cinematic  zombie  and its  infection  of  public  space.  The  zombie  body  is  often  seen  in  the  public sphere:  town  squares,  cemeteries,  schools,  streets,  and  even  in  malls—providing  overt  social  critique.  The  fear  that  the  public  realm  is  being  invaded by  pure  necessity,  or  pure  consumption,  is  expressed  through  the  drama  of the  inhuman,  ever-consuming  zombie. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:100)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, </h3>
Zombies,  like  all  things  that  are feared,  are  the  products  of  the  culture  that  shapes  them  and  bear  within their  myths  the  imprint  of  existing  social  conditions. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008, 101)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, HUMANO, DISTOPIA</h3>
The  zombie  speaks  to  humanity’s  anxiety  about  its  isolation  within the  individual  body,  and  our  mortality  is  burlesqued  by  the  zombie’s  grotesque  defiance  of  the  human’s  finite  existence,  thus  calling  into  question which  is  more  terrifying:  our  ultimate  separation  from  our  fellow  humans,  or the  dystopic  fantasy  of  a  swarm  organism.

  The  zombie  is  not  purely an  expression  of  the  pressing  social  concerns  of  the  historical  moment  in which  it  appears  (be  it  colonization,  slavery,  or  capitalist  servitude),  but, rather,  it  is  given  structure  by  these  historical  events  and  at  bottom  represents  a  crisis  as  old  as  the  mind  itself,  concerning  the  mortality  of  the  flesh. (LAURO & EMBRY, 101)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, MORTE</h3>
The  vulnerability  of  the  flesh  and  the  instinctual  fear  of  its  decay, as  well  as  the  dissolution  of  consciousness—all  things  that  happen  as  we approach  death—are  suggested  in  the  monstrous  hyperbolic  of  the  zombie  as  living  corpse. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:101)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, PÓS-HUMANO.</h3>
  The  corpse  itself  has  the  ability  to  terrify  by  implication,  but  the  animate  corpse,  a  walking  contradiction,  may  frighten  most  deeply  because it  represents  not  only  our  future  but  our  present.  Our  bodies  are  something  that  we  may  fear  and  reject,  but  from  which  we  cannot  part.  The  zombie  as  bodily  specter  thus  refutes  the  resistance  to  embodiment  of  which many  posthumanist  models  are  accused.(LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:101-102)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, HUMANO, ZUMBI, APOCALIPSE</h3>
  We  are all,  in  some  sense,  walking  corpses,  because  this  is  inevitably  the  state  to which  we  must  return.  In  imagining  that  humans  are  burdened  with  their own  deaths,  we  can  come  to  see  one  of  the various  ways  that  the  zombie terrifies:  not  as  an  apocalyptic  vision  but  as  a  representation  of  the  lived human condition. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:102)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI</h3>
  Here  we  want  to  put  forth  a  few  examples  of  “real-life  zombies”  (pardon  the  paradoxes),  in  order  to  illustrate  that  the  indeterminability of  the  zombie  as  boundary  figure  extends  to  its  undecidability  as  metaphoric  or  literal,  fantastic  or  real,  for  this  vein  of  inquiry  opens  up  a  discussion  of  the  various  power  dynamics  that  are  put  into  play  when  we  take  up the zombii as an ontic object. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:102)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI</h3>
In  Julia  Kristeva’s  investigation  of  the  “waste  body”  of  the  corpse,  she refers  to  the  puerperal  fever  epidemic  that  was  caused  by  the  introduction of  bacteria  from  decaying  bodies  into  the  open  wombs  of  delivering  women: “Puerperal  fever  is  the  result  of  the  female  genitalia  being  contaminated by  a  corpse;  here  then  is  a  fever  where  what  bears  life  passes  over  to  the side  of  the  dead  body.  [A]  distracting  moment  when  opposites  (life/death, feminine/masculine)  join.”  In  this  example,  we  see  the  first  of  the  real-life zombies  that  we  want  to  posit.  This  is  also  an  interesting  moment  where  the Western  doctor  lines  up  with  the  Haitian  hungan  as  zombi(e)  makers.  The woman  afflicted  with  puerperal  fever  was  a  zombie,  a  combination  of  dead and  living  flesh,  if  only  at  the  molecular  level. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:102)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI</h3>
  In  the  example  of  the  woman  with  puerperal fever,  therefore,  this  distrust  of  the  female  body’s  ability  to  regenerate  itself, zombie-style,  is  metaphorized  as  the  reproductive  woman  becomes  a  living corpse. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:102)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, AGAMBEN</h3>
The  mentally  ill  historically  have  been  portrayed  as  having  a  consciousness that  is  morally  suspect  or  a  total  lack  of  subjectivity.  As  Giorgio  Agamben notes,  “incurable  idiots”0  were  on  the  Nazis’  list  of  those  who  occupy  the indeterminate  state  wherein  they  could  be  supposed  to  have  neither  the will  to  live  nor  the  desire  to  die;  this  is  used  as  justification  for  their  extermination. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:102)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, FOUCAULT, ZUMBI, LOBOTOMIA</h3>
In  Madness  and  Civilization,  Michel  Foucault  notes  many  of  the treatments  that  were  used  to  cure  mental  illness  in  the  eighteenth  and nineteenth  centuries.  Among  the  rituals  associated  with  attempts  to  purify the  body  was  the  bizarre  notion  that  the  corruption  of  the  mind  could  be prevented  if  the  living  body  was  embalmed  like  a  corpse.  In  this  way, treatment  of  the  mentally  ill  made  them  into  symbolic  zombies  long  before failed  shock  treatment  and  botched  lobotomies  would,  by  causing  severe brain  damage,  make  them  more  literally  resemble  the  animated  corpses incapable of demonstrating agency  or  expression that we see in film. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:102-103)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, </h3>
The  embalmed  madmen  are  real-life  zombies:  like  the  women with  puerperal  fever,  who  were  contaminated  with  the  bacteria  that  infest corpses,  these  were  real  bodies  that  straddled  the  civic  and  social  border  which  determines  the  difference  between  the  living  and  the  dead. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:103)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, </h3>
  In  the  example  of  the  embalmed  madmen,  we  see how  the  social  death  of  the  mentally  ill,  deemed  inferior,  is  translated  into  a literal  transgression  of  these  vital  boundaries,  as  the  living  are  construed  as already  dead  and  treated  accordingly.  There  is  yet  a  third  “real  live  zombie” that  we  want  to  put  forth,  one  that  is  a  contemporary  example  and  that  we might  claim  as  both  a  cyborg  and  a  zombie,  thus  bearing  fruitful  discussion of the overlap between these two categories: Terri Schiavo. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:103)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI</h3>
  What  most  interests  us  here,  however, is  the  aspect  of  the  debate  that  surrounded  Schiavo’s  indeterminability as  living  or  dead.  Her  parents,  who  opposed  their  son-in-law’s  desires  to remove  Terri’s  feeding  tube,  released  video  of  Schiavo  blinking  and  appearing  to  smile.  The  issue  of  whether  the  outward  appearance  of  cognition reflects  an  internal  awareness  of  one’s  circumstances  directed  the  argument. (...)   In  order  for  Michael  Schiavo  to  establish  that  his  wife was  truly  in  a  persistently  vegetative  state,  he  would  have  to  establish  not only  that  she  was  unable  to  communicate  but  that  she  was  unaware  of  her surroundings. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:103-104)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, HARAWAY, ZUMBI, CIBORGUE, </h3>
We  offer  these  real-life  zombies  in  direct  contrast  to  Haraway’s cyborgs.  For  Haraway’s  examples  of  real  cyborgs—a  seamstress  at  her sewing  machine  and  a  quadriplegic  in  her  wheelchair—becoming  cyborg  is not  purely  a  material  experience  but  involves  a  discursive  transformation: we  become  cyborgs  when  we  decide  to  be  cyborgs.  Haraway  thus  requires a  moment  of  cognition,  a  moment  of  consciousness,  that  always  insists upon  subjectivity. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:104)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, IDENTIDADE</h3>
Regardless,  in  the  zombii’s  purest  form  as  an  ontic/hauntic  object,  transformation  must  be  created  outside  the  body,  proclaimed  by  others.  The  zombii cannot see itself as such, much less claim a zombie identity for itself. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:104)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, CAPITALISMO, CIBORGUE, PÓS-CIBORGUE, PÓS-HUMANO, ESCRAVO, DIALÉTICA</h3>
We  have  looked  at  many  different  ways  in  which  the  zombie  can  be conceptualized:  we  see  the  zombie  as  animal  laborans,  the  reified  laborer of  capitalist  production,  and  the  zombie  as  threatening  body,  the  zombie as  brain-dead,  the  zombie  as  brain  eater,  the  zombie  blindly  following  its own  primal  urges;  the  zombie  that  is  pure  necessity,  the  zombie  that  is  antiproductive,  the  zombie  that  is  female,  the  zombie  that  is  avid  consumer; we  have  looked  at  the  zombie  as  cyborg,  the  zombie  as  postcyborg,  the zombie  as  posthuman,  the  zombie  as  slave,  and  as  slave  rebellion.  We have  mentioned  the  zombies  of  folklore  and  of  cinema,  as  figurative,  as symbolic, as literal, as analogy. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:104-105)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, PÓS-HUMANO, ZUMBI, CAPITALISMO, </h3>
 If  the  potential  of  the posthuman  subject  exists  in  its  collectivity  (and  in  its  multiplicity  and  its hybridity),  then  the  posthuman  zombii  is  that  which  forfeits  consciousness as  we  know  it—embracing  a  singular,  swarm  experience.  What  the  zombii reveals,  therefore,  is  that  the  inauguration  of  the  posthuman  can  only  be  the end  of  capitalism.  This  is  not  a  utopic  vision,  nor  is  it  a  call  to  arms.  We  are merely  noting  that  capitalism  and  posthumanism  are  more  linked  than  has been  previously  articulated:  one  has  to  die  so  that  the  other  can  begin. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:106)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, PÓS-HUMANO, ZUMBI, DIALÉTICA, CAPITALISMO, </h3>
  Appositely, posthumanity  can  only  really  be  attained  when  we  pull  the  trigger  on  the ego.  To  kill  the  zombie,  you  must  destroy  the  brain,  and  to  move  posthuman, to  lay  humanism  and  its  legacy  of  power  and  oppression  in  the  grave,  we have  to  undo  our  primary  systems  of  differentiation:  subject/object,  me/ you.  In  fact,  these  terms  cannot  be  separated—like  the  deathlife  of  the zombie,  the  capitalist  superstructure  and  the  posthuman  fantasy  have been  yoked  together  in  a  monstrous  body,  the  existence  of  one  state  prohibits  the  presence  of  the  other. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:106)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, CAPITALISMO, HAITI, SUJEITO</h3>
  If  the  subject  survives the  apocalypse,  so  will  capitalism.  As  we  see  in  one  recent  zombie  film, Danny  Boyle’s  2002  film  28  Days  Later,  the  Haitian  Revolution  is  rehearsed with the effect that the individual is spared. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:107)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, ZUMBI, PÓS-HUMANO, CAPITALISMO</h3>
  If  our  future  involves  this  kind  of  zombie,  the  zombie  rebelling  against  its  servitude,  it  suggests  the  possibility  that  we  can  combat the  forces  that  determine  our  subject  status,  but  this  would  be  a  humanist rather  than  a  posthuman  future.  In  the  film,  the  zombie  body  is  sacrificed to  save  the  last  humans,  and  at  the  end  of  the  film  we  get  the  sense,  as  a military  plane  flies  overhead,  that  everything—humanity,  government,  and most likely  capitalism—has survived the attack. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:107)

<h3>LAURO & EMBRY, MONSTRO, ZUMBI, PÓS-HUMANO</h3>
  So,  to  reformulate  Franco  Moretti’s question:  will  the  end  be  monstrous,  or  will  it  be  liberating?  This  is  an  unanswerable  question,  but  regardless,  it  is  a  question  that  can  only  be  posed  in the  future  tense.  When  we  become  zombiis,  when  we  lose  our  subjectivity and  the  ability  to  rationalize,  there  will  be  no  difference  between  the  two. Therefore, when we truly become posthuman, we  won’t even  know  it. (LAURO & EMBRY, 2008:108)
