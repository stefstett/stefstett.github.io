<h3>WHITEHEAD, </H3>

THE PROGRESS OF CIVILISATION is not wholly a uniform
. drift towards better things. It may perhaps wear this
aspect if we map it on a scale which is large enough.
But such broad views obscure the details on which rests
our 'whole understanding of the process (WHITEHEAD, 1925, p. 01)

<h3>WHITEHEAD, </H3>

The sixteenth century of our era saw the disruption
of Western Christianity and the rise of modern science.
It was an age of ferment. Nothing was settled, though
much was opened-new worlds and new ideas. In
science, Copernicus and Vesalius may be chosen as
representative figures: they typify the new cosmology
and the scientific emphasis on direct observation (WHITEHEAD, 1925, p. 01)

<h3>WHITEHEAD, </H3>

The thesis which these lectures will illustrate is that
this quiet growth of science has practically recoloured
our mentality so that modes of thought which in former
times were exceptional are now broadly spread through
the educated world. This new colouring of ways of
thought had been proceeding slowly for many ages in
the European peoples. At last it issued in the rapid
development of science; and has thereby strengthened
itself by its most obvious application. The new mentality is more important even than the new science
and the new technology. It has altered the metaphysical presuppositions and the imaginative contents of our
minds; so that now the old stimuli provoke a new
response (WHITEHEAD, 1925, p. 02)

Another contrast which singles out science from
among the European movements of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries is its universality. Modern scien<;e .
was born in Europe, but its home is the whole world (WHITEHEAD, 1925, p. 03)

<h3>WHITEHEAD, </H3>

My theme is the energising of
a state of mind in the modern world, its broad genÂ·
eralisations, and its impact upon other spiritual forces.
There are two ways of reading history, forwards and
backwards. In the history of thought, we require both
methods. A climate of opinion-to use the happy phrase
of a seventeenth century writer-:-requires for its under standing the consideration of its antecedents and its
issues. Accordingly in this lecture 1. shall consider some
of the antecedents of our modern approach to the investigation of nature (WHITEHEAD, 1925, p. 03-04)

<h3>WHITEHEAD, </H3>

For we shall find that since
the time of Hume, the fashionable scientific philosophy
has been such as to deny the rationality of science. This
,onclusion lies upon the surface of Hume's philosophy (WHITEHEAD, 1925, p. 04)

<h3>WHITEHEAD, </H3>

If the cause in itself discloses no information as to the
effect, so that the first invention of it must be entirely
arbitrary, it follows at once that science is impossible,
except in the sense of establishing entirely arbitrary
connections which are not warranted by anything intrinsic to the natures either of causes or effects. Some
variant of Hume's philosophy has generally prevailed
among men of science. But scientific faith has risen to
the occasion, and has tacitly removed the philosophic
mountain (WHITEHEAD, 1925, p. 04)

<h3>WHITEHEAD, </H3>

Certainly from the classical Greek civilisation. onwards there have been men, and indeed groups of
men, who have placed themselves beyond this acceptance of an ultimate irrationality. Such men have endeavoured to explain all phenomena as the outcome
of an order of things which extends to every detail (WHITEHEAD, 1925, p. 05)

<h3>WHITEHEAD, </H3>

Nevertheless, Greece was the mother of Europe; and
it is to Greece that we must look in order to find the
origin of our modern ideas (WHITEHEAD, 1925, p. 07)

<h3>WHITEHEAD, </H3>

Galileo
owes more to Aristotle than appears on the surface of his
Dialogues: he owes to him his clear head and his analytic
mind (WHITEHEAD, 1925, p. 13)

<h3>WHITEHEAD, </H3>

But science is not merely the outcome of instinctive
faith. It also requires an active interest in the simple
occurrences of life for their own sake (WHITEHEAD, 1925, p. 14)

<h3>WHITEHEAD, </H3>

The progress of science has now reached a turning
point. The stable foundations of physics have broken up:
also for the first time physiology is asserting itself as an effective body of knowledge, as distinct from a scrapheap. The old foundations of scientific thought are becoming unintelligible. Time, space, matter, material,
ether, electricity, mechanism, organism, configuration,
structure, pattern, function, all require reinterpretation.
What is the sense of talking about a mechanical explanation when you do not know what you mean by mechanics? (WHITEHEAD, 1925, p. 17-18)

<h3>WHITEHEAD, </H3>

But the revival of philosophy in, the
hands of Descartes and his successors was entirely
coloured in its development by the acceptance of the
scientific cosmology at its face value. The success of their
ultimate ideas confirmed scientists in their refusal to
modify them as the result of an enquiry into their rationality. Every philosophy was bound in some way or
other to swallow them whole. Also the example of sci- ,
ence affected other regions of thought. The historical
revolt has thus been exaggerated into the -exclusion of
philosophy from its proper role of harmonising the various abstractions of methodological thought. Thought is
abstract; and the intolerant use of abstractions is the
major vice of the intellect (WHITEHEAD, 1925, p. 19)

<h3>WHITEHEAD, </H3>

They asked that reason should be used. Faith in
reason is the trust that the ultimate natures of things lie
together in a harmony 'which excludes mere arbitrariness. It is the faith that a,  the base of things we shall
not find mere arbitrary mystery. The faith in the order
of nature which has made possible the growth of science
is a particular example of a deeper faith. This ;faith cannot be justified by any inductive generali sation (WHITEHEAD, 1925, p. 19-20)

THE SCIENCE OF PURE MATHEMATICS, in its modern developments, may claim to be the most original creation
of the human spirit. Another claimant for this position
is music. But we will put aside all rivals, and consider
the ground on which such ' a claim can be made {or
mathematics. The originality of mathematics consists in
the fact that in mathematical science connections between things are exhibited which, apart from the agency
of human reason, are extremely u obvious (WHITEHEAD, 1925, p. 20)

<h3>WHITEHEAD, </H3>

When we think of mathematics, we have in our mind
," a science devoted to the exploration of number, quantity,
geometry, and in modern times also including investigation into yet more abstract concepts of order, and into
analogous types of purely logical relations. The point of
mathematics is that in it we have always got rid of the
particular instance, and even of any particular sorts of
entities (WHITEHEAD, 1925, p. 22)

<h3>WHITEHEAD, </H3>

In other words, we may
think that some abstract postulate is necessary which is
if! fact capable of being proved from the other postulates that we have already on hand (WHITEHEAD, 1925, p. 24)
