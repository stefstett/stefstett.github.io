            <h3>RAGLIN, ZUMBI, GUERRA </h3>
            
            While it has become de rigueur to portray the zombie onslaught as a war, this analogy is in fact seriously flawed and can result in lethal outcomes for humans who hew to orthodox strategies of offensive of defensive warfare. Consider that the zombie warfare is not driven by a religious motive or geopolitical objective (RAGLIN, 2014, p. 227)
            
            <h3>RAGLIN, ZUMBI, GUERRA</h3>
            
            Conceptualizing the zombie conflict according to Carl von Clausewitz's (1873) definitions of either limited or total war is problematic, because humans cannot prevail over zombies by enforcing a truce or negotiating terms for surrender (RAGLIN, 2014, p. 227)
            
            <h3>RAGLIN, LINGUAGEM, ZUMBIS, VOZ</h3>
            
            While zombies do not possess a spoken language and show no outward signs of direct awareness of other team members, they do exhibit a shared comprehension that a zombie howl signals that humans are nearby (RAGLIN, 2014, p. 230)
            
            <h3>RAGLIN, ZUMBI, CONSCIÃŠNCIA</h3>
            
            Although zombies lack awareness of other members of their team, research indicates that organized and even quasi intelligent group behaviors can arise in non-sentient agents given special conditions (Berman <i>et al.</i>; D'Angelo <i>et al.</i>) (RAGLIN, 2014, p. 231)
            
            <h3>RAGLIN, ROMERO UNIT, ZUMBI, NOTLD, BROOKS</h3>
            
            The basic unit of zombie speed, herein referred to as the Romero Unit (i,e., 1.0 <sup>RU</sup>), was calculated by observing ambulating zombies in <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> (1968) and from data provided by Max Brooks (<i>Zombie Survival Guide</i>), whose description of zombie pace is the most detailed found in the published literature. The basic Romero unit was determined by timing the footpace of ambulating zombies in <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>, and it was observed that the average stride (i.e., two footsteps) was completed at a frequency of .50 herts (Hz), meaning it took two seconds to complete (RAGLIN, 2014, p. 233-234)
            
            <h3>RAGLIN, ROMERO UNIT, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            Zombies, however, exhibit only one discrete transition in gait mechanics: they either walk at a shamble or somewhat more briskly, or they run at impressive speeds (RAGLIN, 2014, p. 235)
            
            <h3>RAGLIN, CANIBALISMO, AUTO-CANIBALISMO</h3>
            
            One possibility is that the zombies acquire the chemical energy for skeletal muscle movement through catabolism of both fat and lean body mass, a process colloquially referred to as self-cannibalization. (The only example of this found in the zombie canon was discussed in an episode in the third season of <i>The Walking Dead</i>) (RAGLIN, 2014, p. 241)
