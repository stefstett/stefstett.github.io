             <h3>BOOM, HAITI, VOODOO, ESPÍRITO</h3>
            
            But during the nineteenth century, as African religious beliefs collided with Western influences and zombie mithology anderwent the vicissitudes of cultural migration, the term came to represent a spirit that can occupy people (still an external). Eventually, in Haiti, the external disappeared and the term came to refer to a person for whom internal consciousness and volition were absent - a "zombie drone" (one of the nine classifications of zombies found in literature, film and culture that are fleshed out at the end of this chapter) (BOOM, 2011, p. 53).
            
             <h3>BOOM, CONSCIÊNCIA, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            In lacking counsciousness, the zombie is incapable of examining self. It is emptied of being, a receptacle of nothingness, wholly other. This is the philosophical foundation of the zombie as it was when introduced to Western culture in the early twentieth century (BOOM, 2011, p. 54)
            
             <h3>BOOM, HAITI</h3>
            
            The fear that the Haitian zombie drone engenders comes from more than its unusual origins. The potential loss of self leads to existential despair and dread (BOOM, 2011, p. 54)
            
             <h3>BOOM, CORPO</h3>
            
            The zombie as it appears in literature and film during the first half of the twentieth century is primarily a physical body occupied by nothingness - a human shell lacking whatever properties are presumed to contitute self to our counsciouness. This is the zombie found in films such as <i>White Zombie</i> (1932), <i>King of the Zombies</i> (1941), <i>I Walked with a Zombie</i> (1943), and <i>Revenge of the Zombies</i> (1943), and in literature such as "The Country of the Comers-Back" (1889) by Lafcadio Hearn, "The Hollow Man" (ca. 1920-45) by Thomas Burke, <i>The Whistling Ancestors</i> (1936) byt Richard E. Goddard, and <i>Tell my Horse</i> by Zora Reale Hurston (BOOM, 2011, p. 54)
            
             <h3>BOOM, SUBJETIVIDADE, ZUMBI </h3>
            
            Because self was all that remained after the bomb, the loss of self became the greatest fear. If self is lost, all that remains is an abyss of nothingness - precisely what the post-nuclear zombie came to signify (BOOM, 2011, p. 55)
            
             <h3>BOOM, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            Thus we find in the post-nuclear world that the instinctual human fear of being dead occupies second place to a more intimate fear of being undead, and that the living death of the zombie is more monstrous than the grave (BOOM, 2011, p. 57),
            
             <h3>BOOM, NOVE CATEGORIAS</h3>
            
            ZOMBIE DRONE<br><br>

The zombie drone is the classic zombie. Thether dead first of nor, it is robbed of its self and becomes a witless shell used for slave labor. The Haitian zombie falls into this category. [...] The zombie drone appearance in literature dates back to the nineteenth century.<br><br>
            
            ZOMBIE GHOUL<br><br>
            
            The zombie ghoul is Romero's creation, a fusion of the Haitian undead zombie, with the flesh-eating ghoul. The zombie ghoul, like the zombie drone, is missing an essential self and operates to varying degrees as an eating machine. This is the most common zombie found in film and literature, present in nearly every zombie film or novel made after the mid eighties. [...]<br><br>
            
            TECH ZOMBIE<br><br>
            
            Found both in film and literature, the tech zombie is someone robbed of volition by technology. [...]<br><br>
            
            BIO ZOMBIE<br><br>
            
            The bio zombie is one that has been deprived of its essential self or its volition by some external substance, either temporarily, [...] or permanently [...]. The course of zombification can vary from chemicals to viruses, but some substance has caused the loss of self. [...]<br><br>
            
            ZOMBIE CHANNEL<br><br>

            Primarily found in literature, the zombie channel is a combie that has been taken over by another counsciousness. [...]<br><br>
            
            PSYCHOLOGICAL ZOMBIE<br><br>
            
            This zombie has been robbed of will through some psychological means such as hypnotism, [...] or brainwashing, [...].<br><br>
            
            CULTURAL ZOMBIE<br><br>
            
            Cultural zombie have not yet received the attention they deserve, yet they offer a fascinating bridge between zombie mythology and the wider, general culture. [...] The main characteristics of cultural zombies are that they acquire the basic qualities associated with zombies, though they occupy narratives that do not employ fantasy, science fiction, or the supernatural.<br><br>
            
            ZOMBIE GHOST<br><br>
            
            The zombie ghost does not qualify as a zombie proper, but the category is necessary because so many stories that are essentially ghost stories are included in zombie anthologies or mentioned in discussions of zombies. We might attribute this misnomer to the overemphasis often placed on returning from the dead. [...].<br><br>
            
            ZOMBIE RUSE<br><br>
            
            The category of zombie ruse is necessary primaly because of books made for children, which use the word "zombie" to entice readers though the work does not contain any zombies. [...] It is, essentially, a marketing ploy that exploits the popularity of zombie stories by invoking it in the title without presenting actual zombies in the plot. This trick is so prevalent that these works warrant their own category (BOOM, 2011, p. 57-60).
