<h3>DOTSON, NOTLD, CRÍTICAS</h3>
          Although only initially given a limited
release, Night became an overnight success with audiences and helped spark a new trend
called “midnight movies”—the late night screening of mostly low-budget independent
horror films. While it seemed audiences could not get enough of Night of the Living
Dead, critics continued to dismiss the film, including Vincent Canby of the New York
Times who called Night, “a grainy little movie made by some people in Pittsburgh” (qtd.
in Gagne 35). (DOTSON, 2006:02)  
            
<h3>DOTSON, CRÍTICAS, NOTLD, VIETNAM </h3>
            Although I agree with those critics who assert issues surrounding the Vietnam
War are raised in Night of the Living Dead (as well as are many other sociopolitical
issues which are well worth exploring), the Vietnam imagery of the film has been almost
exclusively analyzed at the expense of exploring what I believe is another important
aspect of Night of the Living Dead— its re-inscription of blackness in the zombie film. (DOTSON, 2006:04)
            
<h3>DOTSON, ZUMBI, NEGRITUDE</h3>
            Through an historical analysis of the zombie as a figure of horror during the
twentieth century, I show how the zombie has, since the beginning of its arrival in the
West, been associated with blackness.(DOTSON, 2006:05)
            
<h3>DOTSON, ROMERO, NOTLD, BEN </h3>
            It was not until George A. Romero’s Night of
the Living Dead in 1968 that the zombie genre would be renewed. Although perhaps
unintentionally, Romero rewrote the entire rules of the genre when he returned blackness
to the zombie film. Instead of depicting black characters as mindless zombie slaves,
traditional representatives of xenophobia and a supposed black threat in many previous American zombie films, Romero re-cast the black character as the hero—a character
never before seen in a zombie film. Exploring the lineage between black actors and the
zombie film, reveals that Night of the Living Dead is an important film to the study of
blackness on the American screen. (DOTSON, 2006:05-06)
            
<h3>DOTSON, WHITE ZOMBIE, HAITI</h3>
            For most of its viewers, White Zombie was their first introduction to the walking
dead. By the time the film was released in 1932, the United States was finalizing its
occupation of Haiti, and the public’s interest in the island was at its pinnacle. No doubt
the film’s narrative of a young white woman being kidnapped by black Haitians appealed
to an ethnocentric audience who wanted to believe the island, and the Caribbean in
general, was ruled by wild primitives and needed to be rescued by the United States. As
well, the film reveals the most overt coding of blackness in early American zombie films
is the use of blackness to signal exoticism as a combination of mystery and danger, with the films depicting the clash between white and black cultures. (DOTSON, 2006:20)
            
<h3>DOTSON, ZUMBI, WHITE ZOMBIE</h3>
            There is no lead black zombie or group of black zombies who
are prominently featured in the film. Rather, the black zombies exist mostly for scare
tactics. The black zombies work at Legendre’s sugar mill, while the white zombies, who
include a pirate and a scholar, do not engage in physical labor. (DOTSON, 2006:23)
            
<h3>DOTSON, ZUMBI, HAITI, WHITE ZOMBIE</h3>
            
            Rather than featuring living dead as the central characters, the Halperins simply
appropriated black Haitian zombies to serve as part of the mise-en-scene in order to add a
sense of doom and eeriness to the setting. This tactic of using blackness as part of the
background terror in zombie films would be continued until the sixties (DOTSON, 2006:24)
            
<h3>DOTSON, THE GHOST BREAKERS, RAÇA</h3>
            When the black actor was not reduced to playing the exotic extra zombie slave, he
played the dumb sidekick to a white hero. In films using this black/white formula, the
jokes are often at the expense of the African American sidekick and are consistently racebased. Such a pairing was utilized in Paramount’s 1940 horror comedy The Ghost
Breakers in which Willie Best, playing a valet, was paired with Bob Hope who played
popular radio host Larry Lawrence (DOTSON, 2006:24)
            
<h3>DOTSON, THE GHOST BREAKERS, BRANQUITUDE</h3>
            Like the extra black
zombie, the black sidekick in the zombie film exists largely to play to white humor or
fear. (DOTSON, 2006:26)
            
<h3>DOTSON, WHITE ZOMBIE, CORPO NEGRO </h3>
            The zombie films that adopted
these racial codes seemed to be suggesting that only a black body would ever be so
defiled as to be turned into a walking corpse. While the black zombie would be depicted
as a decaying and disgusting animal, the white zombie usually remained in bed looking
pale but pristine in all white dressing gowns. This kind of message about the black body
was not unusual in American films at the time. (DOTSON, 2006:27)
            
<h3>DOTSON, PLAGUE OF THE ZOMBIES, PROLETARIADO </h3>
            In The Plague of the Zombies, and other British zombie films of the period, much
like the American zombie films of the fifties, the ties between the zombie and the
Caribbean were completely severed. The Plague of the Zombies is set entirely in the
British countryside, a change in location that would be typical of British zombie films
during this period. By using a local setting, the horror was transferred onto working class
whites. Rather than projecting horror onto black Haitians, as the early American zombie
films did, The Plague of the Zombies and other British films of the sixties turned the
locals into the monsters, a shift that would be important to the later redevelopment of the
entire genre by Romero. (DOTSON, 2006:34)
            
<h3>DOTSON, NOTLD, NEGRITUDE, ROMERO</h3>
            Considering Night is a horror film featuring a black lead
character, Reade and Continental had reason to believe they might earn money from the
film. As Kevin Hefferman explains, “Horror films were very popular with African
American audiences. In fact, on the rare occasions when theaters in African American
neighborhoods in Philadelphia played a film’s first run, it was often for mass openings of horror combinations” (207). (DOTSON, 2006:45-46)
            
<h3>DOTSON, BEN, BRANQUITUDE, ROMERO, </h3>
            Jones’s Ben is a noble and intelligent character, and as Nelson George notes,
“Like Poitier and St. Jacques, Jones projects an urbane, upwardly mobile attitude in his
idealized role as the ever resourceful black survivor” (7). However, unlike many of the
50
characters Poitier played, Jones’s character is full-bodied and much more than just a
replica of what white Hollywood considered to be a “good black man.” Originally
envisioned by Romero as a slightly ignorant hard-working truck driver, Ben is a normal
guy who, unlike the “good black man” stereotype, played often by Poitier, does not have
an unbelievably self-sacrificing drive (DOTSON, 2006:49-50)
            
<h3>DOTSON, BEN, NEGRITUDE </h3>
            
             Although Cooper never uses any racial slurs
against Ben, the argument seems to have racial undertones, what with a white man with a
family fighting against a young black man who is traveling alone, a character who had
typically been suspect in American films. (DOTSON, 2006:52)
            
<h3>DOTSON, NOTLD, BEN, ROMERO, MORTE </h3>
            Such a nihilistic ending was unbelievable to
audiences who were used to seeing the hero conquer the monster, no matter what. It
seemed unfairly ironic that Ben, after surviving the zombie attacks against all odds, is
killed by a human. To complicate matters, although Spainhower argues that Ben “is
mistaken for a zombie” by the posse (183), Romero seems to be at least suggesting that it
was not an accident after all. Following Ben’s death are the final scenes of the film: still
frames of Ben’s body being dragged by meat hooks to a pile of bodies that are lighted on
fire, a scene all too reminiscent of lynchings, during which the dead bodies of African 
57
Americans would often be mutilated and burned. (DOTSON, 2006:56-57)
            
<h3>DOTSON, NEGRITUDE, BRANQUITUDE, NOTLD</h3>
            Gagne believes the film is ripe with racial
symbolism and argues that in 1968 the film “was a metaphor for the black experience in
America, particularly when the black man is killed by the white posse at the film’s end”
(37). Considering that Night was released in 1968, when racial tension and anger was
mounting, it is hard to deny the idea that the film, and especially the film’s ending, could
be a metaphor for the black experience in the United States (DOTSON, 2006:60)
