<h2>BISHOP, 2006</h2>

<h3>BISHOP, FREUD, UNCANNY, ZUMBI</h3>
This unique embodiment of horror recalls Sigmund Freud’s concept of the uncanny, which finds itself better suited to filmic representations rather than prose renditions. (BISHOP, 2006:196)

<h3>BISHOP, HORROR, ZUMBI</h3>
Whereas many horror films may be easily dismissed as mindless entertainment or B-reel schlock, the zombie film retains its ability to make audiences think while they  shriek. (BISHOP, 2006:196)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, ROMERO</h3>
Although creatures such as vampires and reanimated corpses often have  been realized by literary means, the traditional zombie story has no direct antecedent in novels or short fiction. In fact, zombies did not really see the light of day until filmmakers began to dig them out of their graves in the 1930s.  The “classic” zombie horror film, which is the focus of this investigation, was pioneered by George  A. Romero in the late 1960s and features a veritable plague of reanimated corpses that attack and slaughter the living. (BISHOP, 2006:196-197)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, CINEMA</h3>
Although the cinematic popularity of zombies has certainly made the move  to video games and graphic novels, the zombie remains a primarily nonliterary phenomenon. (BISHOP, 2006:197)

<h3>BISHOP, MONSTRO, ZUMBI, VOODOO</h3>
Most classic monsters—from ghosts to vampires to werewolves— have  their origins in folklore, and the zombie is no exception. However, whereas those other creatures have cross-cultural mythologies, the zombie remains a purely  American monster, born from  Vodoun magic and religion. (BISHOP, 2006:197)

<h3>BISHOP, HORROR, ZUMBI</h3>
Although possessing certain thematic characteristics that tie it to the traditions of classical horror, the zombie is “the only creature to pass directly from folklore to the screen, without first having an established literary tradition” (2–3).  This singularity makes an investigation of the anthropological roots of the zombie an essential part of understanding the film genre. (BISHOP, 2006:197)

<h3>BISHOP, DAVIS, ZUMBI</h3>
According to anthropologist  Wade Davis, the modern English word  zombie most likely derives from the Kimbundu term  nzúmbe, which means “ghost” or “spirit of a dead person” (xii). (BISHOP, 2006:197)

<h3>BISHOP, ESCRAVO, ZUMBI, AUTÔMATO</h3>
This concept was brought from Africa to Haiti with the slave  trade and was translated into the Creole zõbi, which was modernized to  zombie,a word with a number of accepted meanings, from a mindless automaton to an exotic mixed drink. (BISHOP, 2006:197)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, ESCRAVO, HUMANO</h3>
the designation of  zombie is reserved for the cannibalistic walking dead: people brought back to life either to serve  or to devour the human race. (BISHOP, 2006:197)

<h3>BISHOP, DAVIS, HAITI, VOODOO, ZUMBI</h3>
Davis is the world’s leading authority on the zombification ritual, and as a Harvard University ethnobotanist, he traveled to Haiti in 1985 in search of exotic new medicinal drugs. Davis recorded his weird experiences and botanical research in  The Serpent and the Rainbow.6 According to this primarily anthropological text, a limited number of powerful and unorthodox Vodoun priests, called  bokors, possess a keen knowledge of natural drugs and sedatives and have  created a “zombie powder”—called  coup poudre—that renders its victims clinically dead (Davis 90).(BISHOP, 2006:198)

<h3>BISHOP, DAVIS, </h3>
If the powder is too strong or mixed incorrectly, the victim might die immediately—or suffocate slowly in the coffin (Davis 226). Unfortunately, even those victims lucky enough to be rescued from the grave inevitably suffer brain damage from the lack of oxygen; they are understandably sluggish and dimwitted (Davis 21). (BISHOP, 2006:198)

<h3>BISHOP, HUMANO, FREUD, UNCANNY, ZUMBI</h3>
The corpses are hidden from sight and mind.  Although statues, portraits, and photographs are treasured as valued reminders of those now dead, no one really wants to see the face of a loved one slowly rot or be reminded of the brutal realities of mortality; such a confrontation would be frightening, to say the least. In psychoanalytical terms, Freud identifies this fear of the once familiar as the  unheimlich, a  complex term that literally means “un-homely” or “un-homey” but is usually translated as “the uncanny.” This concept is key to understanding the ability of the zombie to instill fear: (BISHOP, 2006:198)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, WHITE ZOMBIE, HAITI, VOODOO</h3>
Hollywood quickly recognized the marketability of the zombie, with the first true zombie movie arriving the same year as  Webb’s  play: Victor Halperin’s  White Zombie (1932). Set in Haiti, Vodou is the central feature of the film, although the tone and style are obviously influenced by  Tod Browning’s  Dracula (1931). (BISHOP, 2006:198)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, ESCRAVO, MONSTRO, VOODOO</h3>
These zombies are slow, dimwitted, and lumbering—but not completely mindless; they  can follow commands and perform simple tasks.  They  are not monsters but rather hypnotized slaves who are still alive  and can be saved with the death of the  Vodoun priest who enslaved them. (BISHOP, 2006:198)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI</h3>
A number of similar, if unremarkable, zombie films were made over the next few years—for example, Revolt of the Zombies (1936), King of the Zombies (1941), and  I  Walked with a Zombie  (1943)—but their rather prosaic view of the undead would change gradually over the next few decades with the help of EC Comics. (BISHOP, 2006:199)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, HAITI, VOODOO, ROMERO</h3>
The essential motifs and tropes of the classic zombie movie have  some thematic and stylistic roots in Haitian travel narratives and the zombie films of the 1930s and ’40s, specifically the exoticism of  Vodoun zombie folklore, and early horror and science fiction cinema, particularly the end-of-theworld scenario. In addition, the paranoia narratives of the cold war 1950s and ’60s would have  given Romero some core ideas about his general plot structure, but it was his own imagination and invention that united the zombie legend with these popular stories of the primal struggle for survival. (BISHOP, 2006:200)

<h3>BISHOP, HUMANO, ZUMBI</h3>
  Their lack of emotional depth, their inability to express or act on human desires, and their primarily visual nature make zombies ill suited for the written word; zombies thrive best on screen. (BISHOP, 2006:200)
    
<h3>BISHOP, FREUD, UNCANNY, ROMERO, ZUMBI</h3>
Freud defines the abstract concept of the uncanny as “that species of the the debilitating effects of the grave are treated with revulsion and fear—especially when said creatures are hostile, violent, and ambulatory. frightening that goes back to what was once well known and had long been familiar” (124). He further points out how “this uncanny element is actually nothing new or strange, but something . . . estranged from [the psyche] only through being repressed” (147).  The With the creation of  Night of the Living Dead, Romero decisively established the structure of the classical zombie movie, and many directors have since followed his lead. true manifestation of this fear occurs, therefore, when a repressed familiarity (such as death) returns in a disturbing, physical way (such as a corpse); the familiar (heimlich) becomes the unfamiliar or uncanny (unheimlich) (Freud 148). (BISHOP, 2006:200)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, CORPO, AUTÔMATO</h3>
But ghosts are merely spirits, consciousnesses that lack physical form; zombies belong to a much more specific phylum: the corporeal monster. Such unnatural terrors include vampires (demons who constantly cheat death by preying on the living), golems (unnatural creatures reassembled and brought back to life through the means of science), and zombies (mindless automatons fueled by purely animalistic passions). (BISHOP, 2006:200)

<h3>BISHOP, UNCANNY</h3>
His unnatural state makes him essentially uncanny: He is a collection of dead body parts and stitchery, a creature brought back to life through science, not the supernatural. (BISHOP, 2006:201)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, UNCANNY, HUMANO, MONSTRO, FALA</h3>
Zombies are not uncanny because of their humanistic qualities; they  are uncanny because they are, in essence, a  grotesque metaphor for humanity itself. Like the vampire, the zombie rises from the grave to feed off the living. Like the golem, the zombie has the form of someone familiar, yet monstrous. But the zombie is a much different creature from these established monsters: It does not think or act on reasonable motives—it is purely a creature of blind instinct.  The zombie does not recognize individuals or discriminate in its quarry. Zombies have  no speech or consciousness— they  do not talk to their victims or speculate about their existence; they are essentially superficial, two-dimensional creatures. (BISHOP, 2006:201)

<h3>BISHOP, FALA, CORPO</h3>
Because zombies do not speak, all of their intentions and activities are manifested solely through physical action. In other words, because of this sensual limitation, zombies must be watched. (BISHOP, 2006:201)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, HUMANO, ALTERIDADE</h3>
  Although they  were once human, zombies have  no real connection to humanity aside from their physical form; they  are the ultimate foreign Other. (BISHOP, 2006:201)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, FALA, MONSTRO</h3>
They  do not think, speak, or act on passionate or conscious desires as do the monsters found in novels or short fiction—a zombie’s essentially silent and shallow nature makes it a fundamentally visual creature instead.  The primitive  characteristics of these ghouls make them ideal cinematic monsters. (BISHOP, 2006:201)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, ROMERO</h3>
Zombie movies are always set at the apparent end of the world, where devastating events have  rendered the human race all but helpless. Yet, the primary details in Romero’s films are in essence bland and ordinary, implying that such extraordinary events could happen to anyone, anywhere, at any time. (BISHOP, 2006:201)

<h3>BISHOP, ROMERO</h3>
Night of the Living Dead is presented on a very pessimistic stage: that of the apocalypse.  A strange phenomenon overcomes society, resulting in a literal hell on earth where the dead walk and no one is safe. (BISHOP, 2006, 202)

<h3>BISHOP, ROMERO, FICÇÃO</h3>
  A space probe has returned from  Venus, bearing some kind of unknown radiation. For some unexplained reason, this extraterrestrial fallout causes all recently dead humans to rise and attack the living—no Vodoun  rituals  here. (BISHOP, 2006:202)

<h3>BISHOP, HUMANO</h3>
 Society’s infrastructure begins to break down, especially those systems associated with the government and technology. Law enforcement is depicted as incompetent and backwater (the local sheriff is a stereotyped yokel with a “shoot first” attitude), so people must fend for themselves instead. (BISHOP, 2006:202)

<h3>BISHOP, HUMANO, </h3>
 In the end, the rigid structure of society proves little help; human survivors are left to their own devices with no real hope of rescue or support. Motley groups are forced into hiding, holing up in safe houses of some kind where they  barricade themselves and wait in vain for the trouble to pass. (BISHOP, 2006:202)

<h3>INTRODUÇÃO, BISHOP, ZUMBI, FICÇÃO</h3>
Of course, such a scenario is not necessarily limited to zombie movies: Slasher films and alien-invasion pics often have  a similar modus operandi. However, whereas those movies feature either an unrealistic cast of vivacious eye candy, computer-savvy geniuses, or stylized superheroes, zombie cinema pursues the hapless adventures of bland, ordinary (heimlich) citizens. (BISHOP, 2006:202)

<h3>BISHOP, UNCANNY, ROMERO</h3>
The literal  heimlich nature of the house quickly becomes something far more  unheimlich.  The farmhouse symbolizes the comforting idea that one’s home is a place of security, but this place does not belong to either Barbara or Ben—it is a foreign, unfamiliar environment, and they are indeed strangers in a strange land. (BISHOP, 2006:203)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, MONSTRO, HUMANO</h3>
In his afterword to the graphic novel  Miles Behind Us, a  zombie story told in another primarily visual medium, Simon Pegg points out that the protagonists of zombie movies are not superheroes or professional monster slayers such as  Van Helsing— they  are common, average folk forced to “step up” and defend themselves. (BISHOP, 2006:203)

<h3>BISHOP, UNCANNY, URSINI, HORROR</h3>
James Ursini writes, “Horror is based on recognizing in the unfamiliar something familiar, something attractive  even as it is repulsive. . . .  The best horror films are those that evoke that feeling of the uncanny in us most strongly” (5)(BISHOP, 2006:203)

<h3>BISHOP, MONSTRO, ZUMBI, MORTO-VIVO, VÍTIMA</h3>
  This perspective  on the monster is most apropos the zombie movie, in which the threat is not only manifested as a hostile undead human but likely a hostile undead human the victim recognizes as a former intimate. (BISHOP, 2006:203)

<h3>BISHOP, HUMANO, MORTO-VIVO, AMEAÇA </h3>
As Dillard points out, “The living people are dangerous to each other . . . because they are potentially living dead should they die” (22) (BISHOP, 2006:203)

<h3>BISHOP, ZUMBI, HUMANO, TRASFORMAÇÃO, </h3>
Because anyone can potentially become a zombie, these films deal unabashedly with human taboos, murder, and cannibalism, which Dillard proposes have  much to do with the genre’s success (15).  The dead are not allowed to rest in peace: Barbara’s attempt to honor the resting place of one relative  turns into a nightmare in which she vainly combats the remains of another dead relative.  (BISHOP, 2006:204)

    <h3>BISHOP, HUMANO, ZUMBI, MINSTRO, HORROR</h3>
The horror of the zombie movie comes from recognizing the human in the monster; the terror of the zombie movie comes from knowing there is nothing to do about it but destroy  what is left; the fun comes from watching the genre continue to develop.  Although zombies are technically dead, their cinematic genre is a living, breathing entity that continues to grow and evolve. (BISHOP, 2006:204)
