             <h3>HAYLES, </h3>
            
            What, finally, are we to make of the posthuman?l At the beginning of this
book, I suggested that the prospect of becoming posthuman both evokes
terror and excites pleasure. At the end of the book, perhaps I can summarize the implications of the posthuman by interrogating the sources of this
terror and pleasure. The terror is relatively easy to understand. "Post," with
its dual connotation of superseding the human and coming after it, hints
that the days of "the human" may be numbered (HAYLES, 1999, p. 283)
            
             <h3>HAYLES, </h3>
            
            Humans can either go
gently into that good night, joining the dinosaurs as a species that once
ruled the earth but is now obsolete, or hang on for a while longer by becoming machines themselves (HAYLES, 1999, p. 283)
            
             <h3>HAYLES, </h3>
            
            Fortunately, these views do not exhaust the meanings of the posthuman.
As I have repeatedly argued, human being is first of all embodied being,
and the complexities of this embodiment mean that human awareness unfolds in ways very different from those of intelligence embodied in cybernetic machines (HAYLES, 1999, p. 283-284)
            
             <h3>HAYLES, </h3>
            
             Nevertheless, these reflexive complexities do not negate
the importance of the sedimented history incarnated within the body. Interpreted through metaphors resonant with cultural meanings, the body
itself is a congealed metaphor, a phYSical structure whose constraints and
possibilities have been formed by an evolutionary history that intelligent
machines do not share (HAYLES, 1999, p. 284)
            
             <h3>HAYLES, </h3>
            
            The terror, then, though it does not
disappear in this view, tends away from the apocalyptic and toward a more moderate view of seriated social, technological, political, and cultural
changes (HAYLES, 1999, p. 284-285)
            
             <h3>HAYLES, PÓS-HUMANO, ANTIHUMANO</h3>
            
            When the self is
envisioned as grounded in presence, identified with originary guarantees
and teleological trajectories, associated with solid foundations and logical
coherence, the posthuman is likely to be seen as antihuman because it envisions the conscious mind as a small subsystem running its program of selfconstruction and self-assurance while remaining ignorant of the actual
dynamics of complex systems (HAYLES, 1999, p. 286)
            
             <h3>HAYLES, AGÊNCIA</h3>
            
            What Weizenbaum's
argument makes clear is the connection between the assumptions undergirding the liberal humanist subject and the ethical position that humans,
not machines, must be in control. Such an argument assumes a vision of the
human in which conscious agency is the essence of human identity. Sacrifice this, and we humans are hopelessly compromised, contaminated with
mechanic alienness in the very heart of our humanity.I7 Hence there is
an urgency, even panic, in Weizenbaum's insistence that judgment is a
uniquely human function. At stake for him is nothing less than what it
means to be human (HAYLES, 1999, p. 288)
            
             <h3>HAYLES, PÓS-HUMANISMO, AGÊNCIA, ORGANISMO</h3>
            
            In the posthuman view, by contrast, conscious agency has never been "in
control." In fact, the very illusion of control bespeaks a fundamental ignorance about the nature of the emergent processes through which consciousness, the organism, and the environment are constituted. Mastery
through the exercise of autonomous will is merely the story consciousness
tells itself to explain results that actually come about through chaotic dynamics and emergent structures (HAYLES, 1999, p. 288)
            
             <h3>HAYLES, SUBJETIVIDADE, CONSCIÊNCIA</h3>
            
            The chaotic, unpredictable
nature of complex dynamics implies that subjectivity is emergent rather
than given, distributed rather than located solely in consciousness, emerging from and integrated into a chaotic world rather than occupying a position of mastery and control removed from it (HAYLES, 1999, p. 291)
            
             <h3>HAYLES, PÓS-HUMANO</h3>
            
            The best possible time to contest for what the
posthuman means is now, before the trains of thought it embodies have
been laid down so firmly that it would take dynamite to change them.24 Although some current versions of the posthuman point toward the antihuman and the apocalyptic, we can craft others that will be conducive to the
long-range survival of humans and of the other life-forms, biological and
artificial, with whom we share the planet and ourselves (HAYLES, 1999, p. 291)
