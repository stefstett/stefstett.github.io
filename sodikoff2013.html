<h3>SODIKOFF, BIOLOGIA, MORTO-VIVO</h3>
 In conservation biology, the term living dead species refers to species populations that have become critically small and therefore doomed to die out. (SODIKOFF, 2013:141)

<h3>SODIKOFF, BIOLOGIA, MORTO-VIVO</h3>
My focus on how conservation science and environmental degradation forge temporal perception in Madagascar reflects my broader interest in discerning how cultural and biological extinctions, habitat loss, and interventions into these processes are shaping twenty-first-century subjectivities. (SODIKOFF, 2013:141)

<h3>SODIKOFF, EXTINÇÃO, ANTROPOCENO</h3>
The accelerated rate of extinction and climate change provokes us to identify ourselves not only as devastating biological agents, as Alfred Crosby proved in his sweeping account The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492, but also as geological agents, capable of disrupting geophysical processes on a planetary scale. (SODIKOFF, 2013:141)

<h3>SODIKOFF, EXTINÇÃO</h3>
The bleakest view of the future has been put summarily by Australian microbiologist Frank Fenner, who recently said that “homo sapiens will not be able to survive the population explosion and ‘unbridled consumption,’ and will become extinct, perhaps within a century, along with many other species.” (SODIKOFF, 2013:142)

<h3>SODIKOFF, CLASSE, FUTURO</h3>
With respect to the political economy of temporal perception, a recent questionable though provocative study suggests that people in wealthier nations—a minority of the global population by far—have a keener interest in future trends than people in developing countries, at least judging by their terms in Google, which are more future oriented.15  (SODIKOFF, 2013:142)

<h3>SODIKOFF, BIOLOGIA, ZUMBI, EXTINÇÃO, APOCALIPSE, </h3>
Conservation biologists’ adoption of the zombie metaphor with reference to species extinction, and the immense popularity of apocalyptic and zombie themes in US and European television and film, say something about the subjective experience of planetary change in the global North and the ways we are projecting the shape of things to come.17 “This is our extinction event,” says a character who works for the Centers for Disease Control in the HBO zombie series The Walking Dead.  (SODIKOFF, 2013:142)

<h3>SODIKOFF, EXTINÇÃO, </h3>
This imagery is not unique to US and European societies but also pervades the imaginations of rural Malagasy people. The effects of the sixth mass extinction and global climate change, of which Homo sapiens are the perpetrators and will be the eventual victims, are especially hard on subsistence-based societies living in forest fragments and on islands and coastal areas around the world. (SODIKOFF, 2013:142-143)

<h3>SODIKOFF, EXTINÇÃO, </h3>
Populations in these regions suffer the reduction of nutritious food sources and minerals, water pollution, flooding, and severe weather events, as well as the social responses to these transformations: specifically, the raft of state and foreign interventions designed to mitigate the damages. (SODIKOFF, 2013:143)
    
<h3>SODIKOFF, RESSUREIÇÃO, ZUMBI</h3>
 I organize these disparate sites of activity around the concept of “resurrection” to understand how dominant formations of space-time are conceptualized in the twentyfirst century. Resurrection invokes the metaphorical language of conservation biology, occult idioms in Madagascar, and popular culture in the United States and Europe, where zombies are all the rage (as opposed to the UFOs and aliens that preoccupied audiences of the 1950s and ’60s) (SODIKOFF, 2013:143)

<h3>SODIKOFF, CLASSE, CIVILIZAÇÃO, PASSADO</h3>
Moreover, ideologies of cultural difference, intrinsic to modern philosophies of history, that have condoned global social inequalities as inevitable and imperialist quests as “civilizing missions” are being disassembled, insofar as international agents of conservation and development are prone to valorizing elements of the evolutionary “past” deemed more biologically robust, environmentally sustainable, and data rich. (SODIKOFF, 2013:144)

<h3>SODIKOFF, HUMANO, SOBREVIVÊNCIA</h3>
Having scarred the planet, human beings have become preoccupied with surviving, as anthropologists have noted. Marc Abélès declares that the matter of survival now lies at the “heart of political action.”27 Celia Lowe sees evolutionary science at the center of a “vital politics” in that its paramount concerns are to maintain the ability of life-forms to evolve and speciate, to maintain the still-existing store of resources that make the sustaining of life possible. (SODIKOFF, 2013:144)

<h3>SODIKOFF, SUBALTERNO, </h3>
This is not to say that subaltern societies are enjoying a moment of ascendancy in Western hierarchies of moral value; rather, select traits of indigenous culture—bits of indigenous knowledge and cognition, bits of biochemical and physiological data about endemic species, for example—are lighting the path forward. Conservation missions to “rewild” depleted habitats and reify heritage for tourism markets reflect deep misgivings about the homogenization of nature, the taming of DNA, and the extinction of indigenous knowledge. (SODIKOFF, 2013:144)

<h3>SODIKOFF, MORTO-VIVO</h3>
 Living dead creatures animate the time delay of extinction debt: “The doomed species do not all die at once,” explains Stuart Pimm, “but are spread over time as determined by the species survivorship curve.”3 (SODIKOFF, 2013, 147)

<h3>SODIKOFF, MORTO-VIVO</h3>
One might say here that the aepyornis, a sole member of its species that, once hatched, reenters an ecology very different from that of its earlier existence, becomes a “living dead” species. (SODIKOFF, 2013:147)

<h3>SODIKOFF, ZUMBI, PÓS-COLONIAL</h3>
Lesley Sharp’s ethnographic work on possessing spirits (tromba) and zombies (lolo angatra and lolo vokatra) in northern Madagascar, in Sakalava territory, illustrates the panoply of living dead beings that haunt the postcolonial landscape of Madagascar and serve as emblems of “highly localized anxieties projected through a symbolic of 158 | The Time of Living Dead Species difference.”85 She writes of people’s fears and descriptions of migrant zombies of Tandroy ethnicity who wander Madagascar’s northwest plantation region and “rob living Sakalava of their livelihood.”86 (SODIKOFF, 2013:157)

<h3>SODIKOFF, ZUMBI, AUTO-ANIQUILAÇÃO</h3>
With zombies, one confronts the risk of self-annihilation by Lazarus effect. It is probably a universal truth that zombies are associated with loss and decline. The living human being’s encounter with a zombie, whether projected on the screen or the mind’s eye, resembles gazing into a warped mirror in which the law of time is contorted and a dead self has risen. Zombies signify a bad death, a resurrection that perverts the moral order. (SODIKOFF, 2013:158)

    <h3>SODIKOFF, MORTO-VIVO</h3>
*** I have suggested that contemporary societies are cathecting their existential anxieties onto the image of the living dead and that this image materializes both in cultural formations and in scientific metaphor. In Madagascar, where extinction debt has given birth to numerous living dead creatures, conservation interventions are building a novel perception of the future (SODIKOFF, 2013:158)
