            <h3>SARTRE, ELITE, CULTURA OCIDENTAL</h3>
            
            The European elite undertook to manufacture
a native elite. They picked out promising adolescents; they
branded them, as with a red-hot iron, with the principles
of Western culture; they stuffed their mouths full with
high-sounding phrases, grand glutinous words that stuck
to the teeth. After a short stay in the mother country they
were sent home, whitewashed. These walking lies had
nothing left to say to their brothers; they only echoed (SARTRE, 1968, p. 7)
            
            <h3>SARTRE, COMUNICAÇÃO</h3>
            
            (What? They are
able to talk by themselves? Just look at what we have
made of them! We did not doubt but that they would
accept our ideals, since they accused us of not being faithful to them (SARTRE, 1968, p. 8)
            
            <h3>SARTRE, MONSTRUOSIDADE, HUMANISMO</h3>
            
            By and large, what they were saying was this: "You are
making us into monstrosities; your humanism claims we
are at one with the rest of humanity but your racist
methods set us apart." Very much at our ease, we listened
to them all (SARTRE, 1968, p. 8)
            
            <h3>SARTRE, SUPEREXPLORAÇÃO</h3>
            
             If they
were, the experts told us, asking for anything at all precise
in their wailing, it would be integration. Of course, there
is no question of granting that; the system, which depends
on overexploitation, as you know, would be ruined (SARTRE, 1968, p. 8)
            
            <h3>SARTRE, DIAGNÓSTICO</h3>
            
            But on the contrary, when Fanon
says of Europe that she is rushing to her doom, far from
sounding the alarm he is merely setting out a diagnosis (SARTRE, 1968, p. 9)
            
            <h3>SARTRE, COLONIALISMO</h3>
            
            If he demonstrates
the tactics of colonialism, the complex play of relations
which unite and oppose the colonists to the people of the
mother country, it is for his brothers; his aim is to teach
them to beat us at our own game (SARTRE, 1968, p. 10)
            
            <h3>SARTRE, VIOLÊNCIA</h3>
            
            Violence in the colonies does not only have for
its aim the keeping of these enslaved men at arm's length;
it seeks to dehumanize them. Everything will be done to
wipe out their traditions, to substitute our language for
theirs and to destroy their culture without giving them
ours. Sheer physical fatigue will stupefy them. Starved
and ill, if they have any spirit left, fear will finish the job;
guns are leveled at the peasant; civilians come to take
over his land and force him by dint of flogging to till the
land for them. If he shows fight, the soldiers fire and he's
a dead man; if he gives in, he degrades himself and he is
no longer a man at all; shame and fear will split up his
character and make his inmost self fall to pieces (SARTRE, 1968, p. 15)
            
            <h3>SARTRE, INUMANO </h3>
            
            The
more farseeing among us will be, in the last resort, ready
to admit this duty and this end; but we cannot help seeing
in this ordeal by force the altogether inhuman means that
these less-than-men make use of to win the concession of
a charter of humanity. Accord it to them at once, then,
and let them endeavor by peaceful undertakings to deserve
it (SARTRE, 1968, p. 21)
            
            <h3>SARTRE, HUMANIDADE, MORTE </h3>
            
            We find our
humanity on this side of death and despair; he finds it
beyond torture and death. We have sown the wind; he is
the whirlwind. The child of violence, at every moment he
draws from it his humanity. We were men at his expense,
he makes himself man at ours: a different man; of higher
quality (SARTRE, 1968, p. 24)
            
            <h3>SARTRE, MONSTRUOSIDADE </h3>
            
            And that super-European monstrosity, North America?
Chatter, chatter: liberty, equality, fraternity, love, honor,
patriotism, and what have you. All this did not prevent
us from making anti-racial speeches about dirty niggers,
dirty Jews, and dirty Arabs. High-minded people, liberal
or just softhearted, protest that they were shocked by such
inconsistency; but they were either mistaken or dishonest,
for with us there is nothing more consistent than a racist
humanism since the European has only been able to become a man through creating slaves and monsters (SARTRE, 1968, p. 26)
            
            <h3>SARTRE, VIOLÊNCIA</h3>
            
            Violence has changed its direction.
When we were victorious we practiced it without its seeming to alter us; it broke down the others, but for us men
our humanism remained intact (SARTRE, 1968, p. 28)
            
            <h3>SARTRE, INVOLUÇÃO</h3>
            
            Involution starts; the native recreates himself, and we,
settlers and Europeans, ultras and liberals, we break up.
Rage and fear are already blatant; they show themselves
openly in the nigger-hunts in Algiers. Now, which side
are the savages on? Where is barbarism? Nothing is missing, not even the tom-toms (SARTRE, 1968, p.28)
