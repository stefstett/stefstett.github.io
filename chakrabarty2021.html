<h3>CHAKRABARTY, PANDEMIA, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA</h3>

The current pandemic, the rise of authoritarian, racist, and xenophobic
regimes across the globe, and discussions of renewable energy,
fossil fuel, climate change, extreme weather events, water shortage, loss
of biodiversity, the Anthropocene, and so on, all signal to us, however
vaguely, that something is amiss with our planet and that this may have
to do with human actions. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 01)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, GLOBALIZAÇÃO </h3>

This book is about
this emergent object-category
of human concern, the planet, and how it affects our familiar stories of globalization. This conceptual shift has
happened in my lifetime, and I hope I will be forgiven if I begin with a
few autobiographical remarks.(CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 01-02)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENO</h3>

Scientists claimed that humans, in their billions and through
their technology, had become a geophysical force capable of changing,
with fearsome consequences, the climate system of the planet as a whole.
I also learned of the burgeoning scientific literature on the Anthropocene
hypothesis—the proposition that human impact on the planet was
such as to require a change in the geological chronology of earth history
to recognize that the planet had crossed the thresholds of the Holocene
epoch (ca. 11,700 years old) and had entered an epoch deserving of a
new name, the Anthropocene.5 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 03)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA, ANTROPOCENO </h3>

The idea of anthropogenic and planetary climate change does not
face much academic challenge these days, but the idea of the Anthropocene
has been much debated by both scientists and humanist scholars.6
The debate has also made the term into a popular and—as usually happens
with such debates—a polysemic category in the humanities today.
Yet whether or not geologists agree to formalize the label “Anthropocene”
one day, the data amassed and analyzed over the last several years
by the Working Group on the Anthropocene set up by the International
Commission of Stratigraphy in London makes one thing clear: ours is
not just a global age; we live on the cusp of the global and what may be
called “the planetary.”7 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 03)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, GLOBO, CATEGORIAS</h3>

The globe and the planet—as categories standing for the two narratives
of globalization and global warming—are connected. What connects
them are the phenomena of modern capitalism (using the term
loosely) and technology, both global in their reach. After all, greenhouse
gas emissions have increased almost exclusively through the pursuit of
industrial and postindustrial forms of modernization and prosperity. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 04)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, CAPITALISMO, SISTEMA TERRA</h3>

Yet the history of capitalism alone, as it has been told until now, is
not enough for us to make sense of the human situation today. This has
to do with the dawning realization that many of today’s “natural” disasters
are consequences of changes that human socioeconomic institutions
and technologies cause in processes that Earth system scientists
regard as planetary. These processes until now have operated mostly independently
of human activities but have nevertheless been central to
the flourishing of human and other forms of life (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 04)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HAFF, ANTROPOCENO SOCIAL, ANTROPOCENO GEOLÓGICO</h3>

In
a later article, where Haff distinguishes between a “social Anthropocene”—
one “that engages the conditions, motivations and histories of
the world’s peoples, including the role of politics”—and a “geological
Anthropocene,” he reiterates that it is important for humans “to recognise
that the technosphere has agency, and that agency is not the same
as our own.”13 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 06)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, SISTEMA TERRA, TEMPORALIDADE</h3>

If all this and much else about human impact on the planet suggest
to Earth system scientists that the planet may have passed the threshold
of the Holocene and entered a new geological epoch altogether, we
can then say that as humans we presently live in two different kinds of
“now-time”
(or what they call Jetztzeit in German) simultaneously: in our
own awareness of ourselves, the “now” of human history has become
entangled with the long “now” of geological and biological timescales,
something that has never happened before in the history of humanity (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 07)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, COLONIALISMO, MUNDO</h3>

We need to connect deep and recorded histories and put geological
time and the biological time of evolution in conversation with
the time of human history and experience. And this means telling the
story of human empires—of colonial, racial, and gendered oppressions—
in tandem with the larger story of how a particular biological species, Homo sapiens, its technosphere, and other species that coevolved
with or were dependent on Homo sapiens came to dominate the
biosphere, lithosphere, and the atmosphere of this planet. We have to
do all this, moreover, without ever taking our eyes off the individual
human who continues to negotiate his or her own phenomenological
and everyday experience of life, death, and the world—experience that
takes for granted a “world” that today, ironically, no longer presents
itself as simply given. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 07-08)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, AÇÃO POLÍTICA, CONSUMO</h3>

Political action, in this sense, is that which helps humans to be at
home on earth beyond the time of the living. A consumption-driven
capitalism in which all artifacts are up for consumption in the present
would be an antipolitical machine in that it would eventually work against the logic of human dwelling, since dwelling requires artifacts to
endure beyond the lifetime of the living. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 09-10)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, JUSTIÇA CLIMÁTICA</h3>

Questions of climate justice—not only between
the rich and the poor but also between the living and the unborn—
surely fall under the political in this view (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 10)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HISTÓRIA, CLASSE</h3>

After all, we still live in times when
representation of histories of “people without history” remains a debated
question, when the question of sovereignty of those who lost their
lands and civilizations to European occupiers and invaders remains unanswered
(and perhaps, disquietingly, unanswerable), when inequalities
between classes grow more acute and wealth concentrates in the
hands of the so-called
one percent, and when the number of refugees or
stateless people in the world keeps swelling while global capital pursues
technology that drastically changes and threatens the future of human
labor. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 10)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENO, HISTÓRIA</h3>

There is no question of artificially separating
the time of the Anthropocene from the human time of our lives
and history. In many ways, our capacity to act as a geophysical force is
connected to many modern forms of enjoyment (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 11)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, TEMPORALIDADE, CAPITALISMO</h3>

There is an interesting problem of temporality here. Negotiations between
nations at the level of the UN usually assume an open and indefinite
calendar. For instance, we don’t know when there will be peace between
the state of Israel and the Palestinian population or whether the
people of Kashmir will ever live in an undivided land. Those are questions
that belong to an open and indefinite calendar. Similarly, we don’t
know when humans will be successful in ushering in a fair and equitable
world. The struggle against capitalism assumes that there is time
aplenty for our historical questions of injustice to be settled. The climate
problem and all talk of “dangerous” climate change, on the other hand,
confront us with finite calendars of urgent action. Yet powerful nations
of the world have sought to deal with the problem with an apparatus
that was meant for actions on indefinite calendars (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 12)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, CRISE AMBIENTAL, ANTROPOCENTRISMO, ANTROPOCENO</h3>

Yet the planetary environmental crisis calls on us to extend
ideas of politics and justice to the nonhuman, including both the living
and the nonliving. The more this realization sinks in, the more we realize
how irrevocably humanocentric all our political institutions and concepts
are. The important point is that the climate crisis and the Anthropocene
hypothesis together represent an intellectual and political quandary
for humans and warrant new interpretations of the significance
and meanings of what I once called “political modernity.”42 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 13)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENO</h3>

(Without the sciences, there still would have
been atmospheric warming and erratic weather, but there would not
have been an intellectual problem called “planetary climate change”
or “global warming” or even the Anthropocene. This is not to deny the
need to produce two-way,
practical translations in places between
local knowledge, customs, traditions, practices, and a science that is
planetary in scope but to plainly acknowledge that “the local,” by itself,
would have never given us any understanding of the roles that parts of
the world sparsely or not at all inhabited by humans—such the regions
containing the Siberian permafrost or the oceans themselves—play in
processes that determine cooling or warming of the whole planet. CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 14)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, WEISMAN, HISTÓRIA, PARADOXO, MUNDO-SEM-NÓS </h3>

I am drawn to Weisman’s experiment as it tellingly
demonstrates how the current crisis can precipitate a sense of the present
that disconnects the future from the past by putting such a future
beyond the grasp of historical sensibility. The discipline of history exists
on the assumption that our past, present, and future are connected by
a certain continuity of human experience. We normally envisage the
future with the help of the same faculty that allows us to picture the
past. Weisman’s thought experiment illustrates the historicist paradox
that inhabits contemporary moods of anxiety and concern about the
finitude of humanity. To go along with Weisman’s experiment, we have
to insert ourselves into a future “without us” in order to be able to visualize
it. Thus, our usual historical practices for visualizing times, past
and future, times inaccessible to us personally—the exercise of historical
understanding—are thrown into a deep contradiction and confusion.
Weisman’s experiment indicates how such confusion follows from
our contemporary sense of the present insofar as that present gives rise
to concerns about our future (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 23)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, QUATRO TESES</h3>

The scientific consensus around the proposition that the present crisis
of climate change is man-made
forms the basis of what I have to say
here. In the interest of clarity and focus, I present
my propositions in
the form of four theses. The last three theses follow from the first one.
I begin with the proposition that anthropogenic explanations of climate
change spell the collapse of the age-old
humanist distinction—prevalent
in the seventeenth century but dominant really in the
nineteenth—between
natural history and human history and end by
returning to the question I opened with: How does the crisis of climate
change appeal to our sense of human universals while challenging at the
same time our capacity for historical understanding?12 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 26)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HISTÓRIA AMBIENTAL</h3>

Simply put, environmental history—where it was not straightforwardly
cultural, social, or economic history—looked on human beings as biological
agents (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 30)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, </h3>

Scholars writing on the current climate-change
crisis are indeed saying
something significantly different from what environmental historians
have said so far. In unwittingly destroying the artificial but time-honored
distinction between natural and human histories, climate
scientists posit that the human being has become something much
larger than the simple biological agent that he or she always has been.
Humans now wield a geological force (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 30)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HUMANO, AGENTE GEOLÓGICO</h3>

To call human beings geological agents is to
scale up our imagination of the human. Humans are biological agents,
both collectively and as individuals. They have always been so. There
was no point in human history when humans were not biological agents.
But climate scientists’ claims about human agency introduce a question
of scale. Humans can become a planetary geological agent only historically
and collectively, that is, when we have reached numbers and invented
technologies that are on a scale large enough to have an impact
on the planet itself. To call ourselves a geophysical force is to attribute to
us a force on the same scale as that released at other times when there
has been a mass extinction of species.30 We seem to be currently going
through that kind of a period. The current “rate in the loss of species
diversity,” specialists argue, “is similar in intensity to the event around
65 million years ago which wiped out the dinosaurs. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 31)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HISTÓRIA, COLAPSO</h3>

Geological time and the chronology
of human histories remained unrelated. This distance between
the two calendars, as we have seen, is what climate scientists now claim
has collapsed. The period I have mentioned, from 1750 to now, is also
the time when human beings switched from wood and other renewable
fuels to large-scale
use of fossil fuel—first coal and then oil and gas. The
mansion of modern freedoms stands on an ever-expanding
foundation
of fossil-fuel
use. Most of our freedoms so far have been energy intensive (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 32)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENO, ILUMISMO, POLÍTICA</h3>

Logically, then, in the era of the Anthropocene, we need the Enlightenment
(i.e., reason) even more than in the past. There is one consideration
though that must qualify this optimism about the role of reason and that
has to do with the most common shape that freedom takes in human
societies: politics. Politics has never been based on reason alone. And
politics in the age of the masses and in a world already complicated by
sharp inequalities between and inside nations is something no one can
control (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 34)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA</h3>

It is not surprising then that the crisis of climate change should produce
anxieties precisely around futures that we cannot visualize. Scientists’
hope that reason will guide us out of the present predicament is
reminiscent of the social opposition between the myth of science and
the actual politics of the sciences that Bruno Latour discusses in his
Politics of Nature (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 35)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HISTÓRIA, HUMANIDADE</h3>

Without such knowledge of the deep history of humanity it would
be difficult to arrive at a secular understanding of why climate change
constitutes a crisis for humans. Geologists and climate scientists may
explain why the current phase of global warming—as distinct from the
warming of the planet that has happened before—is anthropogenic in
nature, but the ensuing crisis for humans is not understandable unless
one works out the consequences of that warming. The consequences
make sense only if we think of humans as a form of life and look on human
history as part of the history of life on this planet (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 36)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ESQUERDA, ANTROPOGÊNICO, CAPITALISMO, OCIDENTE, IMPERIALISMO, DOMINAÇÃO</h3>

Yet doubts linger about the use of the idea of species in the context
of climate change, and it would be good to deal with one that can
easily arise among critics on the Left. One could object, for instance,
that all the anthropogenic factors contributing to global warming—the
burning of fossil fuel, the industrialization of animal stock, the clearing
of tropical and other forests, and so on—are after all part of a larger
story: the unfolding of capitalism in the West and the imperial or quasi-imperial
domination by the West of the rest of the world (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 39)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENO</h3>

We need to stay with this question a little longer; otherwise the difference
between the present historiography of globalization and the
historiography demanded by anthropogenic theories of climate change
will not be clear to us. Though some scientists would want to date the
Anthropocene from the time agriculture was invented and some from
even earlier—from hominin control of fire, for instance—my readings
mostly suggest that our falling into the current phase of the Anthropocene
(when we begin to regard ourselves consciously as a geological
agent) was neither an ancient nor an inevitable happening. Human
civilization surely did not begin on condition that, one day in his history,
man would have to shift from wood to coal and from coal to petroleum
and gas (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 39)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HUMANIDADE, ANTROPOCENO</h3>

Clearly, nobody is in a position to claim
that there is something inherent to the human species that has pushed
us finally into the Anthropocene. We have stumbled into it. The way to
it was no doubt through industrial civilization. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 40)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, CAPITALISMO, ANTROPOCENO, ILUMINISMO</h3>

At the same time, the story of capital, the
contingent history of our falling into the Anthropocene, cannot be denied
by recourse to the idea of species, for the Anthropocene would not
have been possible, even as a theory, without the history of industrialization.
How do we hold the two together as we think the history of the
world since the Enlightenment? (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 42)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HUMANOS, ALTHUSSER</h3>

Who is the we? We humans never experience ourselves
as a species. We can only intellectually comprehend or infer the existence
of the human species but never experience it as such. There could
be no phenomenology of us as a species. Even if we were to identify
emotionally with a word like mankind, we would not know what being
a species is, for in species history, humans are only an instance of the
concept species as indeed would be any other life-form.
But one never
experiences being a concept. The concept dog, Althusser once famously
said, drawing on Spinoza, does not bark!7 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 43)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, DERRIDA, DOMINAÇÃO</h3>

It is no doubt true, as Derrida and others have pointed
out, that we have an everyday sense of being individual members of
the “human” species through what we precisely share and do not share
with other animals around us.79 But when I speak of humans constituting
a certain formation of domination—a complex of humans, their
technologies, and the animal species that flourish through their association
with humans—I speak of a certain dominant collectivity that even
contains the nonliving (i.e., technology) as part of itself (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 44)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ORGANIZAÇÃO MULTIESPÉCIES</h3>

If the earth’s history
had reached a point where we had a multispecies organization of governance—
something like, say, a Latourian world parliament or a United
Organization for Multi-Species
Governance—that allowed polar bears,
for example, to voice their complaints against humans and ask for adjudication,
the category “dominant species” could indeed be part of what
Heise calls “lived, existential [and political] relations” and carry a meaning
in our everyday experience.81 But that is still a far cry. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 44)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HISTÓRIA, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA, CAPITALISMO</h3>

And without that knowledge that defies historical understanding
(in the phenomenological sense explained above), there is no
making sense of the current crisis that affects us all. Climate change, refracted
through global capital, will no doubt accentuate the logic of inequality
that runs through the rule of capital; some people will no doubt
gain temporarily at the expense of others. But the whole crisis cannot
be reduced to a story of capitalism (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 45)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA, ANSIEDADE GLOBAL, GUERRA NUCLEAR</h3>

The anxiety global warming gives rise to is reminiscent of the days
when many feared a global nuclear war. But there is a very important
difference. A nuclear war would have been a conscious decision on the
part of the powers that be. Climate change has largely been a combination
of intended and unintended consequence of a cascade of human
decisions and actions, and it shows, only through scientific analysis,
the long-term
planetary effects of our actions as a species (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 45)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA, HUMANIDADE, HEGEL, ADORNO</h3>

Yet climate
change poses for us a question of a human collectivity, an us pointing
to a figure of the universal that escapes our capacity to experience the
world. It is more like a universal that arises from a shared sense of a
catastrophe. It calls for a global approach to politics without the myth
of a global identity, for, unlike a Hegelian universal, it cannot subsume
particularities. Borrowing from Adorno, we may provisionally call it a
“negative universal history.”8 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 45)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENO, ADORNO</h3>

Harriet Johnson concludes her study of Adorno’s idea of “negative
universal history” by saying, “The Anthropocene challenges us to decipher
a new universal history because we encounter a set of planetary
forces and temporal scales that could not be a direct object of experience
in our lives yet will be a determining factor for them. Adorno is important
because he looked for ways to tell such stories without, in turn,
naturalizing the extant power relations of social history.”93 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 47)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, AQUECIMENTO GLOBAL ANTROPOGÊNICO, SISTEMA TERRA, CAPITALISMO </h3>

As I argued in the last chapter, Anthropogenic global warming brings
into view the collision—or the running up against one another—of
three histories that from the point of view of human history are normally
assumed to be working at such different and distinct paces that
they are treated as processes separate from one another for all practical
purposes: the history of the Earth system, the history of life including
that of human evolution on the planet, and the more recent history of
industrial civilization (for many, capitalism) (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 49)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, AQUECIMENTO GLOBAL ANTROPOGÊNICO, PALEOCLIMATOLOGISTAS</h3>

Paleoclimatologists, for instance, tell a very long history when it
comes to explaining the significance of anthropogenic global warming.
There is, first of all, the question of evidence. Ice-core
samples of ancient air—more than 800,000 years old—have been critical in establishing
the anthropogenic nature of the current warming.2 There are,
besides, paleoclimatic records of the past in fossils and other geological
materials. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 49-50)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, CRISE CLIMÁTICA, ESCALAS DE TEMPO</h3>

The climate crisis thus produces problems that we ponder on very
different and often incompatible scales of time. Policy specialists
think in terms of years, decades, at most centuries, while politicians
in democracies think in terms of their electoral cycles. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 50)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, COGNIÇÃO, AÇÃO, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA</h3>

Significant gaps thus open up in the existing literature on the climate
problem between cognition and action, between what we scientifically
know about it—the vastness of its unhuman scale, for instance—and
how we think about it when we treat it as a problem to be handled by
the human means and institutions at our disposal. The latter have been
developed for addressing problems we face on familiar scales of time.
I call these gaps or openings in the landscape of our thoughts rifts because
they are like fault lines on a seemingly continuous surface; we
have to keep crossing or straddling them as we think or speak of climate
change. They inject a certain degree of contradictoriness in our
thinking, for we are being asked to think about different scales at once (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 51)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, SISTEMA CLIMÁTICO</h3>

The world climate system,
in other words, has no significant capacity to be a wild card in their
calculations insofar as they can make policy prescriptions; it is there in
a relatively predictable form to be managed by human ingenuity and
political mobilization.12 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 52)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, CLIMA, AQUECIMENTO GLOBAL, CATÁSTROFE, PALEOCLIMATOLOGISTAS</h3>

The first rift that I speak of thus organizes itself around the question
of the tipping point of the climate, a point beyond which global
warming could be catastrophic for humans. That such a possibility
exists is not in doubt. Paleoclimatologists know that the planet has
undergone such warming in the geological past (as in the case of the
PETM event). But we cannot predict how quickly such a point could
arrive. It remains an uncertainty that is not amenable to the usual cost-benefit
analyses that are a necessary part of risk-management
strategies.
As Pearson explains, “BC [benefit-cost
analysis] is not well suited
for making catastrophe policy,” and he acknowledges that the “special features that distinguish uncertainty in global warming are the presence
of nonlinearities, thresholds and potential tipping points, irreversibility,
and the long time horizon” that make “projections of technology,
economic structure, preferences and a host of other variables 100 years
from now increasingly questionable.”22 “The implication of uncertainty,
thresholds, tipping points,” he writes, “is that we should take a precautionary
approach,” that is, “avoid taking steps today that lead to irreversible
changes.”23 But “the precautionary principle,” as Cass Sunstein
explains, also involves cost-benefit
analysis and some estimation of
probability: “Certainly we should acknowledge that a small probability
(say, 1 in 100,000) of serious harm (say, 100,000 deaths) deserves extremely
serious attention.”24 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 54-55)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOGÊNICO</h3>

Human-induced
climate change gives rise to large and diverse issues of
justice: justice between generations, between small island nations and
the polluting countries (both past and prospective), and between developed,
industrialized nations (historically responsible for most emissions)
and the newly industrializing ones (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 56)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HISTÓRIA, ANTROPOCENO, CRISE CLIMÁTICA, HIPÓTESE DA IGUALDADE</h3>

Historically
speaking, it is, of course, true that the richer nations are responsible
for most of the emissions of greenhouse gases as they pursued
models of development that produced an unequal world. But imagine
the counterfactual reality of a more evenly prosperous and just world
made up of the same number of people as today and based on exploitation
of cheap energy sourced from fossil fuel. Such a world would undoubtedly
be more egalitarian and just—at least in terms of distribution
of income and wealth—but the climate crisis could be worse! Our
collective carbon footprint could even be larger than it is today—for
the world’s poor do not consume much and contribute little to the production
of greenhouse gases. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 57)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA, DESIGUALDADE HISTÓRICA</h3>

Those who connect climate change causally
to historical origins/formations of economic inequalities in the modern
world raise valid questions about historical inequalities, but seeing that
as the only cause not only reduces the problem of climate change to that
of capitalism (folded into the histories of modern European expansion
and empires), it also blinds us to the action—or agency, if you will—of
Earth system processes and their unhuman temporalities (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 58)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, POPULAÇÃO, EXTINÇÃO DE ESPÉCIES</h3>

Population is also a problem in yet another sense. The total size and
distribution of humanity matters in how the climate crisis unfolds, particularly
with regard to species extinction (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 59)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, CRISE CLIMÁTICA, REVELAÇÃO</h3>

The climate crisis reveals the sudden coming together—the enjamb
ment,
if you will—of the usually separated syntactic orders of recorded
and deep histories of the human kind, of species history and the history
of the Earth systems, revealing the deep connections through which
the planetary processes and the history of biological life interact with
each other (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 61)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENO, GRANDE ACELERAÇÃO</h3>

When did the Anthropocene begin? The An
thropocene
may well stand for a multitude of environmental problems
we face today collectively, but it is impossible for me, as a historian of
human affairs, not to notice that this period of so-
-called
great accel
eration
is also the period of great decolonization in countries that had
been dominated by European imperial powers and that made a move
toward modernization (the damming of rivers, for instance) over the
ensuing decades and, with the globalization of the last twenty years, toward a certain degree of democratization of consumption as well. I
cannot ignore the fact that “the great acceleration” included the production
and consumption of consumer durables—such as the refrigerator
and the washing machine—in Western households that were touted
as “emancipatory” for women(CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 61-62)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HISTÓRIA, ANTROPOCENTRISMO</h3>

The idea that humans are special has, of course, a long history. We
should perhaps speak of anthropocentrisms in the plural here. There
is, for instance, a long line of thinking—from religions that came long
after humans established the first urban centers of civilization and created
the idea of a transcendental God through to the modern social
sciences—that has humans opposed to the natural part of the world.(CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 63)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, DEUS, CRIADOR, MUNDO</h3>

The very idea of a transcendental God puts humans in a special relationship
with the Creator and his creation, the world(CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 64)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA, ANTROPOCENTRISMO, ÉTICA AMBIENTAL</h3>

The literature on climate change thus reconfigures an older debate
on anthropocentrism and so-called
nonanthropocentrism that has long
exercised philosophers and scholars interested in environmental ethics:
do we value the nonhuman for its own sake or because it is good for
us?
Nonanthropocentrism, however, may indeed be a chimera, for as
Feng Han points out in a different context, “human values will always
be from a human (or anthropocentric) point of view.(CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 64)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, GEOBIOLOGIA </h3>

All of the rifts I have discussed here turn on the difference between
human time and the deeper and longer temporal rhythms of the geobiological
processes that contribute to the making of Earth system history.
Whether we stay with this difference or try to fold it back into the
temporality of human institutions and their history is the question that
constitutes the nub of the debate in which this book is situated (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 65)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, CRISE CLIMÁTICA</h3>

Plane
tary
warming, she writes, “will not stop tomorrow: even if a collective
will to develop an alternative economic regime were to emerge in some
of the planet’s dominant nations, the transition to such a regime would
almost certainly take decades (more likely, a century or more)—too late
to affect the current climate crisis decisively. Žižek’s assumption that
overcoming capitalism is a prerequisite for addressing the climate crisis,
in practice, simply denies the possibility of coming to terms with it.”71 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 66)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, SPIVAK, COAUTORES, CRISE</h3>

Once we grant processes belonging to the deeper histories of Earth
and life the role of coactors in the current crisis, playing themselves out
on both human and unhuman scales, the prescience of a sentence Gayatri
Chakravorty Spivak wrote a while ago comes into view: “The planet
is in the species of alterity, belonging to another system; and yet we in
habit
it.”73 Spivak was on to something. Her formulation takes a step
toward pondering the human implications of the planetary studies that
inform and underpin the science of climate change(CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 67)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA, GLOBAL, PLANETÁRIO</h3>

The scientific problem of climate change thus emerges from what
may be called comparative planetary studies and entails a degree of
interplanetary research and thinking. The imagination at work here
is not human centered. It speaks to a growing divergence in our consciousness
between the global—a singularly human story—and the
planetary, a perspective to which humans are incidental(CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 67)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOGÊNICO, ANTROPOCENO, MODERNIDADE, GLOBALIZAÇÃO</h3>

We could call this a planetary or anthropocenic regime of historicity
to distinguish it from the global regime of historicity that has enabled
many humanist and social-science
historians to deal with the theme of
climate change and the idea of the Anthropocene. In the latter regime,
however, historians try to relate the Anthropocene to histories of modern
empires and colonies, the expansion of Europe and the development
of navigation and other communication technologies, modernity and
capitalist globalization, and the global and connected histories of science
and technology(CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 68)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HEIDEGGER, PLANETA</h3>

Martin Heidegger pronounced
the word
planet as being of no interest to philosophers when he introduced
earth as a philosophical category in 1936, distinguishing it care
fully
from the word
planet. “What this word [earth] says,” he wrote, “is
not to be associated with the idea of a mass of matter deposited some
where,
or with the merely astronomical idea of a planet.(CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 68)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, TERRA, PLANETA, MUNDO</h3>

The earth/world distinction and the earth/planet distinction cut in
different ways for Heidegger’s readers today. If his earth/world distinction
helped him formulate his ideas on human dwelling, his earth/
planet distinction, by contrast, roughly maps onto the division that
some Earth system scientists make between the zone of the planet that
is critical to the maintenance of life—the critical zone, as it is called—
and the rocky, hot, and molten interior of the planet (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 69)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HUMANO, NATUREZA, REGIME ANTROPOCÊNICO DE HISTORICIDADE</h3>

But as
evidence gathers that the nature/human distinction is, ultimately, unsustainable
and that human activities worldwide may even contribute
to the increasing frequency of earthquakes, tsunamis, and other “natural”
disasters, the planet as such has emerged as a site of existential concern
for those who write its histories in what I have called the planetary
or anthropocenic regime of historicity (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 70)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, COLONIALISMO</h3>

Notice how much their sense of what
the earth was for humans (“knowledge of the face of the earth”) was
conditioned, even across centuries, by the history of European expansion,
trade, the mapping and navigation of the seas (and eventually the
air), along with the development of instruments of navigation and mobility—
in other words, processes and institutions that created the modern
sense of the globe (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 71)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, IMPERIALISMO, SUBJETIVISMO, UNIFORMIDADE</h3>

He writes, “In the planetary
imperialism of technologically organized man, the subjectivism of man
attains its acme, from which point it will descend to the level of organized
uniformity and there firmly establish itself. This uniformity be
comes the surest instrument of total, i.e., technological, rule over the
earth.”3(CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 74)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, AQUECIMENTO GLOBAL ANTROPOGÊNICO, </h3>

Anthropogenic global warming is no doubt connected to the story of
globalization. One could even argue that a certain period in the history
of globalization now known as “the great acceleration” (1950 onward)
overwhelmingly contributed to the forging of this connection, so much
so that some scholars have pinned the beginning of the Anthropocene
down to this period itself (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 75)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, SISTEMA TERRA, AQUECIMENTO GLOBAL</h3>

Earth System Science (ESS) is a mode of looking at this planet that, in
contrast to the globe of globalization,
necessarily has other planets in view

in order to create models of how this planet works (and the principles
of representation involved are different from those involved in invoking
the globe). Contrary to what we might imagine, the science of global
warming is not even specific to this planet—it is part of what is called
planetary science.
.38 Indeed, our current warming is simply an instance
of what is called planetary warming. Such warming has happened both
on this planet and on other planets with widely different consequences.
It just so happens that the current warming of the earth is primarily a
result of human actions. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 75)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, BIOSFERA, SISTEMA TERRA</h3>

The deeper parts of the planet affect the biosphere for sure (as plate
tectonics does, for example, or volcanic eruptions do) and are fundamentally
important in supplying geochemically fresh landscapes; the
question is whether they constitute parts of the Earth system. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 77)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, VIDA MULTICELULAR</h3>

The important point for our discussion is that the chief protagonist
of the story that ESS tells is not humans or human life but complex,
multicellular life in general (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 78)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, SISTEMA TERRA</h3>

In other words, the Earth system of ESS is produced not simply by
a physical view of the planet from outside but by reconstituting it into
an abstract figure in the imagination with the help of the sciences—
including information obtained from satellites positioned in space as
well as from ancient ice-core
samples—
while keeping other planets always
in view even if only implicitly (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 79)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, DELF ROTHE, ANTROPOCENO</h3>

Delf Rothe has aptly remarked that the Anthropocene is both
withdrawn from and inaccessible to earthlings like humans: It is, writes
Rothe, “equally totalising and withdrawn: [it] is a new planetary real—
a state-shift
of the entire Earth System that cannot be known or sensed
directly.” (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 79)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, GLOBAL, PLANETÁRIO </h3>

The difference between the global and the planetary is perhaps best
illustrated by a quick contrast between two ideas central, respectively,
to the two categories in question here, the globe and the planet. These
are the ideas of sustainability and habitability. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 81)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HABITABILIDADE, HUMANIDADE</h3>

The problem of habitability therefore
should be distinguished from the discussion on life that has gone on
in the humanities under the rubric of biopolitics (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 83)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, AQUECIMENTO GLOBAL, SISTEMA TERRA</h3>

Global warming produces for Earth
system scientists the fear of another great extinction of life—possible
in the next three hundred to six hundred years—that might make the
planet regress to a more primitive level of biodiversity (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 84)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, GRANDE ACELERAÇÃO</h3>

The planetary now bears
down on our everyday consciousness precisely because the accentuation
of the global in the last seventy or so years—all that is summed up
in the expression “the great acceleration”—has opened up for humanist
intellectuals the domain of the planetary (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 85)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENTRISMO</h3>

How exactly does one en
counter
together (in thought) disparate forms of thinking even when the
phenomena they refer to appear intertwined and when the global and
the planetary—with their respective anthropocentric and nonanthropocentric
emphases and with their references to vastly different and
incommensurable scales of time—often represent two rather differen
orientations to this entity on and from which we live? (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 86)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, GLOBAL, PLANETÁRIO</h3>

The global, as I have said, refers to matters that happen within human
horizons of time—the multiple horizons of existential, intergenerational,
and historical time—though the processes might involve
planetary scales of space. Planetary processes, including the ones that
humans have interfered with, operate on various timetables, some compatible
with human times, others vastly larger than what is involved in
human calculation (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 86)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, FORÇA PLANETÁRIA, ANTROPOCENO</h3>

Humans today have become a planetary
force in that they can interfere with some of these very long-term
processes,
but “fixing them” with the help of technology is still well beyond
our present capabilities. What would it mean for us to bring together
in our thought all these different timescales and, in Connolly’s terms,
face them? (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 86)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, TEMPORALIDADE, MUNDO</h3>

Temporality, however, is not the only thing that distinguishes the
global from the planetary. The two modes of thinking represent two different
kinds of knowledge and, for humans, two different ways of comporting
themselves to the world within which they find themselves (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 86)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ALTERIDADE, PLANETA</h3>

Faced with the radical otherness of the planet, however, a deeply phenomenological
urge on the part of many scientists is to recoil back into
the human-historical
time of the present and address the planet as a
matter of profound human concern—as a critical question of human
futures and as an entity to be governed by humans (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 87)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, CIVILIZAÇÃO, HABITABILIDADE</h3>

“Does such a civilization self-destruct in a few hundred
years or last for millions of years? For such a civilization to last, the species
driving the technology must [consciously and collectively] sustain and foster planetary
habitability rather than ravage planetary resource (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 88)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, FUTURO</h3>

As a student
of human pasts and politics, I find this vision of a future where scientists,
activists, and politicians and their respective constituencies move
““quickly” to recognize errors made on a very large social scale certainly
reasonable but perhaps unlikely (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 88)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, REGIME ANTROPOCÊNICO</h3>

The anthropocenic regime of
historicity as visible in ESS sets humans against a background of relationships
and time that necessarily cannot be addressed from within
the temporal horizon of human experiences and expectations—that is,
from within the global regime of historicity(CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 89)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, CAPITALISMO TARDIO, LATOUR</h3>

Late capitalism, in this sense, destroys the human-political
project the world over. In such circumstances, there is surely the danger,
as Latour points out, of a rebarbarization of the world, a prospect
that many authoritarian leaders and parties today implicitly or explicitly
embody and hold out (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 91)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HUMANIDADE, TECNOSFERA, BIOSFERA</h3>

Are humans now a “God species?”
Should humans make kin with other nonhuman beings? Should human
societies aim to become a part of the natural systems of the planet? Will
the earth become an “intelligent” planet thanks to the integration of the
technosphere and the biosphere? (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 92)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA, JUSTIÇA CLIMÁTICA</h3>

There is an important part of climate change discourse that, it may be
said, sees itself as a continuation of the critique of the inequities of globalization
and is therefore quite compatible with Schmitt’s schema of appropriation
. distribution . production we discussed in the last chapter.
This is the literature on “climate-justice” issues(CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 95)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, CRESCIMENTO, MODERNIZAÇÃO, DESENVOLVIMENTO</h3>

But there is yet another concern of developing nations that underlies
their complaints about the inequities of the impact of climate change
and one that I consider crucial to the argument about the relationship
between climate and global capital: this is the widespread desire for
growth, modernization, development, whatever one calls it, in the less
developed nations of the world (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 96)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, POLÍTICA, DESENVOLVIMENTO</h3>

One cannot debate the politics of climate change without looking at
how issues of “development” affect subaltern modernizers of history. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 97)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, VISÃO NÃO-ANTROPOCÊNTRICA, SISTEMA TERRA, CAPITALOCENO</h3>

A nonanthropocentric view of the world, as discussed in the previous
chapter, is integral to Earth System Science, and therefore whether
we speak of “capitalism in the web of life” or of the “Capitalocene,” it
is difficult if not impossible to ignore—when considering the issue of
climate change—the question of the agency of the nonhuman and the
nonliving.(CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 100)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, CAPITALISMO, ANTROPOCENO, CAPITALOCENO</h3>

Marxist critics who locate the roots of global warming in the story
of global capitalism want to rename the Anthropocene and call it the
Capitalocene or something else that alludes to its social genesis (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 101)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, LATOUR, PURIFICAÇÃO, NATUREZA/CULTURA, HÍBRIDOS</h3>

Latour is absolutely right: the project of purification
goes hand in hand with the proliferation of hybrids, a process
that, as Latour argues, ultimately undercuts the very nature/society or
nature/culture opposition that makes the projects of “thinning” nature
or producing entities in a “pure” state possible at all(CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 103)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTICOLONIAL, LATOUR, ANTROPOCENO</h3>

This is where, I suggest, the story of anticolonial, third-world
modernizers
has to be taken into account. Latour’s engagement with the Anthropocene,
for instance, has been grounded in his earlier critiques of
what he memorably called “the Constitution of the Modern,” a peculiar
constitution that, thanks to its absolute separation (let’s say, from the
seventeenth century on) of nature from society, a version of the nature/
culture opposition, allowed the proliferation of a multitude of hybrids
(things that were neither purely natural nor purely social) while denying
the actual work of translation between the two poles that brought
the
hybrids into being and insisting that the hybrids were a mere mix
ture —a mediation— of two separate and pure forms.(CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 103)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, LATOUR, OCIDENTE, MODERNOS</h3>

Latour suggests, through some cryptic remarks, that this West—
both the fabricator and a fabrication of the Modern—is not without
history. What we have, however, are some very short, brilliant, and suggestive
formulations, such as the one arguing that the Constitution of
the Modern has become burdened with its own contradictions. It is not
difficult either to put some rough bookends to the story of the Constitution
of the Modern (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 104)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTICOLONIAL</h3>

But where are the anticolonial, late-modern,
and the late-modernizing
leaders of Asia and Africa
the Nehrus, the Nassers, the Sukarnos, the Nyereres, the Senghors, the
Frantz Fanons—in this story? (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 105++)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, COLONIZADO, COLONIALISMO, EUROPA, ÁFRICA</h3>

Unless we understand this dream of the colonized—who had been
told to wait for self-rule
until they were “modern” enough to deserve
it—we will not understand the complaint, made in every colony but
voiced famously by Aimé Césaire in the closing paragraph of the first
chapter of his book on colonial discourse, that European colonial rule
amounted to a promise that was deliberately left unfulfilled: “The proof
is that at present it is the indigenous peoples of Africa and Asia who are
demanding schools, and colonialist Europe which refuses them; that it
is the African who is asking for ports and roads, and colonialist Europe
which is niggardly on that score; that it is the colonised man who wants
to move forward, and the coloniser who holds things back.”33 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 106)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, LATOUR, EUROPA, MODERNIDADE</h3>

Latour speaks of “provincializing modernity” as a European task:
since Europe brought it about and spread it throughout the world, it is
now the European intellectual’s task to “provincialize” it, to put it back
in its proper place.54 But, as I argued in Provincializing Europe, Europe
was not the only originator of modernity; third-world intellectuals who
took heart from what they saw as the universal side of certain European
ideas were cooriginators in the process. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 111)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, CAPITALOCENO, PÓS-HUMANISMO</h3>

While there may be specific areas of life—such as women’s reproductive rights—where the language of freedom meshes nicely with
what seems ecologically desirable, this cannot be assumed for all aspects of human life, as the story of air conditioning in India demonstrates. The predicament of the political thinker, I suggest, is deeper.
The insights of the proponents of the Capitalocene and the posthumanists are important and have to be taken on board, but we need to go beyond the story of original “sins” of capital/labor and nature/culture distinctions to understand the human attachment to “thin descriptions” of
nature and thus to modernization. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 113)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, NUSSBAUM, MODERNO</h3>

My point of departure here comes from some stimulating and generative reflections Martha Nussbaum has made on stigmatization and
the emotion of disgust as they feature in the philosophy of modern,
mainly American, law.5 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 115)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HUMANO</h3>

while we cannot not think of human flourishing and questions of justice between humans as we move deeper into the present century, pursuing these questions with no reference to how individual human bodies are connected
to nonhuman elements on the planet—both living and nonliving—can
in the end imperil human flourishing itself (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 117)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HUMANO, MICRÓBIO, CRISE CLIMÁTICA</h3>

That we are made up of “sticky and oozy substances that will all
too soon decay” may have to become a part of our everyday awareness.
Not only that. The point that not humans but microbial and other small
forms of life constitute both by weight and numbers the bulk of life on
the planet and are central to the drama of life—from the production
of soil to the internal workings of the human body, not to speak of the
maintenance of the share of oxygen in the atmosphere—may have to be assigned, as the climate crisis unfolds, the status of a salutary fact that
humans will need to keep in mind in thinking about planetary conditions that make our existence and flourishing possible.10
 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 117-118)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, DALIT, INJUSTIÇA</h3>

5 If we could get out—even in pro-Dalit thought that
only focuses on injustice between humans—of anthropocentric thinking, then we could see the Dalit’s body as the body that makes us aware
of all the networks of connections between different life-forms that enables humans, as a form of creaturely life, to survive. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 126)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HUMANO, PERCEPÇÃO</h3>

 We know, for example, that humans, apart from being an arithmetic sum of the total number of humans on the planet, are also a biological species, Homo sapiens, but that knowledge is usually treated as
being of no special political import. But when biodiversity in the world
faces, for the first time in its entire history, the bleak prospect of a “great
extinction” driven by the activities of one biological species, Homo sapiens, the urgency of creating a sense of politics based on this second
understanding of ourselves as a species deeply embedded in the history of life dawns on us.  (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 127)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HUMANIDADE, KANT, SEPARAÇÃO</h3>

This proposition that in effect subjects
the domain of biological life to the work of the moral life of humans
marks, I argue, a critical turning point for the humanities today, as it
departs radically from a tradition—inaugurated by, among others, Immanuel Kant—that made a strict separation between our “moral” and
“animal” (i.e., biological) lives, assuming that the latter would always
be taken care of by the natural order of things. This separation, after
all, is what has buttressed for more than a century the much-critiqued
gap between the humanities and the physical or biological sciences.
Strands of environmentalist thought have questioned and on occasion
attempted to close this chasm, but the gap persists and has not been
easy to overcome. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 134)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENO</h3>

The question of
how much sacrifice the living should make as they curb emissions to ensure that unborn humans inherit a better quality of life than that of the
present generation remains a more intractable one, its political force
reduced by the fact that the unborn are not present to press their case.
“The nonexistent has no lobby,” as Hans Jonas once remarked, “and the
unborn are powerless.”12
 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 135)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, MODERNIDADE</h3>

Within this
perspective that looks both into deep pasts and deep futures, a very
particular challenge opens up for the imagination of modernity. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 136)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, DOMINÂNCIA, HUMANO</h3>

The phenomenon of the rise of humans to a position of dominance—
due, perhaps, to the development of a big brain that has helped humans
over tens of thousands of years to create attachments and affiliations to
imagined communities far beyond the face-to-face scale of kin group
or band—is now seen by many to have taken place over a very long historical period reaching back to times that Daniel Smail describes as our
“deep history.”1 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 138)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENO, </h3>

“The Anthropocene—whether formal or informal—clearly
has value in giving us a perspective, against the largest canvas, of the
scale and the nature of the human enterprise, and of how it intersects
(‘intertwines’ now, may be a better word) with the other processes of the
Earth system.”32 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 141)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, SEPARAÇÃO</h3>

For it was this very separation
between the animal and moral life of the human species that underlay, for a large part of the twentieth century, the separation of the human from the physical and biological sciences. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 141)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, KANT</h3>

t Immanuel Kant spelled out in a minor essay called “Speculative Beginning of Human History” published in 1786 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 141)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, KANT</h3>

But by the time Kant has the
human being in his sights, reason, a faculty somewhat beyond animal
life and yet put in place by some design of nature, had already begun to
“stir” and “cook up” in humans—in partnership with a companion human faculty, imagination—“desires for things for which there is . . . no
natural urge,” with the result that “man became conscious of reason as
an ability to go beyond those limits that bind all animals.”4 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 143)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, DESEJOS, ANIMAL</h3>

The deepening of this “inner” propensity gave
man the capacity to refuse desires that were merely animal—thus developing the ability to love.  (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 143)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANIMAL, HUMANO</h3>

The pressure that “the animal life” of the human species—our material
and demographic flourishing (in spite of the gross inequities of human
societies)—now puts on the distribution of natural, reproductive life
on Earth, endangering human existence in turn, is something that becomes clearer by the day (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 146)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, VIDA MORAL</h3>

that the moral life of humans assumes that man can “choose his
way of life and not be bound like other animals to only a single one.”58  (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 146)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENTRISMO</h3>

 But think of the problems that
follow from this anthropocentric placing of humans in loco parentis
with regard to “creatures on whose lives we can have a powerful influence.” We never know of all the species on which our actions have a
powerful influence; often we find out only with hindsight. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 148)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, VÍRUS, BACTÉRIA</h3>

 Could we ever be in a
position to value the existence of viruses and bacteria hostile to us except in so far as they influence—negatively or positively—our lives?  (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 148)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, POPULAÇÃO</h3>

8 Besides, any practical proposal for reducing the size
of the human population in effect becomes an antipoor proposition
and is therefore morally repugnant (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 149)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, LATOUR, ANTROPOCENTRISMO, KANT, COLONIZAÇÃO, NÃO-HUMANO</h3>

Latour’s critique of the anthropocentrism of Kant’s thinking uses the metaphor-concept of colonization to create agential space for the nonhuman.
“Things in themselves lack nothing, just as Africa did not lack whites
before their arrival,” he writes (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 150-151)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ESCALAS TEMPORAIS</h3>

The Anthropocene requires us to think on the two vastly different
scales of time that earth history and world history respectively involve:
the tens of millions of years that a geological epoch usually encompasses (the Holocene seems to have been a particularly short epoch if
the Anthropocene thesis is right) versus the five hundred years at most
that can be said to constitute the history of capitalism (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 156)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENO, GEOLOGIA</h3>

Even though it refers to a new period in the planet’s geological history
and therefore to geological time, the term Anthropocene was used from
its very inception as a measure not of geological time—it is not a unit
of time—but of the extent of human impact on the planet (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 156)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENTRISMO, MORAL</h3>

Discussions, scientific or not, of human impact on the planet’s environment could never be completely separated from moral concerns.  (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 157)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENO, ANTROPOCENO GEOLÓGICO, ANTROPOCENO POPULAR</h3>

From the very beginning of its career, then, the Anthropocene has had
two lives, sometimes in the same texts: a scientific life involving measurements and debates among qualified scientists, and a more popular life as a moral-political issue.  (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 158)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENO, MORAL</h3>

It is the moral side of the Anthropocene debate—questions of historical responsibility for the warming that has happened so far—that requires us to translate ideas that have deeply to do with earth history,
geology, and geological time into the language of world/human history.13 This entails, however, two important acts of displacement:
the displacement-translation of the category “force”—referring to the
physical pull that one material body exerts on another (to go by the
Newtonian understanding of it), thus humanity as a geological force—
into the human-existential category of power and its sociologicalinstitutional correlates, and the accompanying dislodging of the problem of the Anthropocene from the realm of geological time to the time
of human or world history.14 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 159)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, AGARAL, NARAIN, HISTORICIDADE, MUDANÇA CLIMÁTICA, MODERNIZAÇÃO</h3>

For Agarwal and Narain, as we have noted before, it was as though
the talk about climate change was creating a cruel and unfair “regime
of historicity”—to speak with François Hartog—that threatened to
foreclose the world-historical time of development in which the future
was an open vista of modernization that the United States and Soviet
Union inspired after the Second World War.18 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 160)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, FORÇA, PODER</h3>

This may not be effective rhetoric goading people into action, but the translation of physical
“force” into the very human terms of “power” and “responsibility” may
be seen to be at work in all texts searching for a planetary human ethics
in the present time. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 162)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, HUMANIDADE HISTÓRICA, TEMPO GEOLÓGICO</h3>

Neither human-historical time nor the time of geology, both being
of human making, is empty of affect. But they engage, as mentioned
before, very different types of affect. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 164)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENO </h3>

They agreed that to define a geological
time unit, “formal criteria must be met.” Yet dating the beginning of
the Anthropocene also remained for them a necessarily moral-political
exercise: “defining an early start date may, in political terms, ‘normalize’ global environmental change. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 168)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENO</h3>

The task of making a formal proposition for the
Anthropocene does not necessarily require the stratigrapher to be interested in the whodunit part of the story.(CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 170)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, CAPITALOCENO, ANTROPOCENO</h3>

One could add “Capitalocene”
to this list of human-centered rather than planet-centered definitions of
the Anthropocene. (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 170)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, ANTROPOCENO</h3>

5 The Anthropocene, in one
telling, is a story about humans. But it is also, in another telling, a story
of which humans are only parts, even small parts, and not always in
charge. How to inhabit this second Anthropocene so as to bring the
geological into human modes of dwelling are questions that remain.
It could indeed take “decades, even centuries,” Jasanoff warns, “to accommodate to . . . a revolutionary reframing of human-nature relationships.”96
 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 178)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, TERRA</h3>

“The earth as
a spherical body . . . certainly is not perceptible as a whole, by a single
person and all at once,” he remarks. It is perceptible only “in a primordial synthesis as the unity of singular experiences bound to each other”
though “it may be the experiential ground for all bodies in the experiential genesis of our world-objectification.” (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 180)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, KANT, NATUREZA, HUMANIDADE</h3>

 As the Kant scholar Douglas Burnham remarks, “nature exists [in Kant’s philosophy] as if it were to be
understood by humans.”3 Every time they look at it, said Heidegger, the
earth rises up to greet humans. Human worlds and the earth are in a
relationship of strife and are yet mutually bonded. To repeat him, “The
opposition of world and earth is a striving.” (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 183)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, EUROPEUS, MODERNIDADE</h3>

Modern Europeans discovered “deep time” in the eighteenth century—the time of geology and biological evolution—and yet modernity
has been about forgetting it at the same time or as simply treating it as a
background to human dwelling on the planet. Events of deep time have
not so far fundamentally affected the experienced time of mutuality
between the earth and humans. But this assumed relationship is under
stress. What we took as the immobile—in human time—background to
human action is now changing because of human action and endangering humanity. As Benjamin would have said about a moment of danger,
it is as we get thrown into the abyss of deep time that an alternative history of modernity “flashes up” before our eyes and with it the possibility
for a new understanding of the pasts of humans.5 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 183)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, MUNDO, HOMEM, MATERIALIDADE, </h3>

Ironically but typically, the “world” that Tagore saw “Man” as being in
a deep relationship with was very lightly loaded with materiality. The
relatively empty but capacious category of “the world”—in its relationship to the human—came to absorb and erase into its vast and vacuous oneness the rich, strange, and intractable diversity of what actually exists. (Tagore’s poetry or songs, on the other hand, would not be
open to this criticism.)  (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 187)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, CONSCIÊNCIA EPOCAL</h3>

Epochal consciousness as a form of thought was supposed to have
two characteristics. It was nonspecialist thought and, more importantly, it was not oriented to finding solutions.58 Epochal consciousness,
Jaspers said, is “granted to man without giving him the rest of a conclusion.” To inhabit such consciousness “takes stamina,” for “it calls for
endurance in the tensions of insolubility.”59 (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 197)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, SISTEMA TERRA</h3>

The Earth system produced a delicate
atmosphere—our “modern” atmosphere—allowing complex animal
and plant life to flourish. That atmosphere has persisted for about four
hundred million years. We depend on it, but it was not made with us in
view. Theoretically, it would be there even if humans had not appeared.  (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 198)

<h3>CHAKRABARTY, MODERNO</h3>

To be modern, then, was to retain an Aristotelian sense of wonderment and curiosity about the world and the universe but lose all sense
of fear as a value (as distinct from fear as an instinct or drive)—except
for the citizen’s political fear of the law and the state, as Hobbes would
say. If this is true, then a task faces the historian of the Anthropocene.
True, modern humans, as both a condition for and a consequence of
their flourishing, have lost the fear of other species. Our life in what we
call human civilization depends crucially on not having to be fearful of
most other life-forms as we go about our everyday business. This is a
basic condition of modern life. But how did we come to lose this fear? (CHAKRABARTY, 2021, p. 200)
