             <h3>CHRISTIE, MATHESON, ROMERO</h3>
            
            The living dead in question were not even zombies originally: Matheson writes of vampires and Romero originally called them "ghouls" (CHRISTIE, 2011, p. 67)
             
             <h3>CHRISTIE, I AM LEGEND</h3>
            
            Unfortunately - and this is where the 2007 film version of <i>I Am Legend</i> gets it completely wrong - Robert Neville is not <i>legend</i> because he represents human society, not because he somehow saves humanity; Robert Neville is legend because he is the single largest threat to a <i>new society</i>, one that has superseded humanity (CHRISTIE, 2011, p. 98)
            
             <h3>CHRISTIE, PÓS-HUMANO, BINARIDADE</h3>
            
            If we are to consider whether the zombie ir or can be representative of the post-human state, we must first purge ourselves of the very binaries that defined the old Cartesian model. If zombies are both alive and dead, if they retain portions of both mind and body, then they force us to rethink the foundational philosophies that have informed our interactions with birth, life, death, and the hereafter (CHRISTIE, 2011, p. 68)
            
             <h3>CHRISTIE, PEPPERELL, PÓS-HUMANO</h3>
            
            Robert Pepperell in his book <i>The Post-Human Condition</i> uses the term "post-human" in a variety of contexts: (1) to designate an end to an era of social theory dubbed humanism, (2) to indicate that our conceptual construction of what it means to <i>be human</i> is undergoing a profound transformation, and (3) to account for the conflation of emerging technologies that "show the balance of power between humans and machines is altering" (CHRISTIE, 2011, p. 68-69).
            
             <h3>CHRISTIE, HARAWAY, DESCARTES</h3>
            
            To borrow loosely from Donna Haraway's "A Cyborg Manifesto", if "there is nothing about being female that naturally binds women together into a unified category", and even the status of "being" female is "itself a highly complex category constructed in contested sexual scientific discourses and other social practices", then can we not consider whether there can be a unified category called <i>human</i> - and if so what, then, are thoso unifying characteristics, because Descartes's old mantra of "I think, therefore I am" seems woefully solipsistic in light of today's scientific and technological advances (CHRISTIE, 2011, p. 70-71)
            
             <h3>CHRISTIE, CATEGORIAS, PEPPERELL </h3>
            
            Thus normative categories are problematic, but this very variety reinforces Robert Pepperell's claim that "the human is identifiable, but not definable"; we identify the sameness of these creatures across a variety of interpretations, but we define them according to context rather than construct (CHRISTIE, 2011, p. 71)
            
             <h3>CHRISTIE, MORTE, EMOÇÃO, INFECÇÃO</h3>
            
            All societal recognition of death as an emotional, symbolic event has been superseded by mass fear of infection: morticians are banned from performing their body preservation services, cemeteries are barred and guarded, "men had been shot trying to bury their loved ones" (CHRISTIE, 2011, p. 72)
            
             <h3>CHRISTIE, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, SHOCK HORROR</h3>
            
            In fact, I would argue that <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> is demonstrative of wht the film critic Adam Lowenstein has called <i>shock horror</i>, or "the employment of graphic, visceral shock to access the historical substrate of traumatic experience" (CHRISTIE, 2011, p. 76)
            
             <h3>CHRISTIE, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, PLATÃO, ANAMNESE</h3>
            
            Where I suggest <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> intersects with the issue of post-humanism is in an adaptation of Plato's theory of anamnesis - a process of remembrance or recollection of the past. Anamnesis, however, also has the medical application of referring to the body's response to a previously encountered antigen - a <i>remembrance</i> of that antigen that prompts a more focused physical response (CHRISTIE, 2011, p. 77)
            
             <h3>CHRISTIE, DESSUBJETIVAÇÃO </h3>
            
            Considered in this light, the depersonalization that is a characteristic of the zombie - bodies without souls - can be reconceived as a problem of identification, an unwillingness to recognize both similarity <i>and</i> difference (CHRISTIE, 2011, p. 77)
            
             <h3>CHRISTIE, FAMILIAR, ALTERIDADE</h3>
            
            Everything that was familiar has been inverted: familial bonds prove deadly for the Coopers, as they do for Barbara, because these figures cannot reconcile themselves to their loved ones becoming the <i>Other</i> (CHRISTIE, 2011, p. 78)
            
             <h3>CHRISTIE, CONSUMO</h3>
            
            The transformation of human into food arguably begins at death itself when, as Shakespeare most famously pointed out, the body becomes mere food for worms, but in <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> the natural order of the process is reversed, as the still living become food for the dead (CHRISTIE, 2011, p. 79)
            
             <h3>CHRISTIE, NEGAÇÃO, CATÁSTROFE</h3>
            
            As R.H.W. Dillard argues, "the plot is... one of simple negation, an orchestrated descent to death in which all efforts toward life fail", demonstrating what the cultural critic Slavok Zizek in <i>Welcome to the Desert of the Real</i> calls the United States' deep psychological attachment to images of catastrophe (CHRISTIE, 2011, p. 79)
            
             <h3>CHRISTIE, ESTADO DE EXCEÇÃO</h3>
            
            Drawing from Giorgio Agamben's concept of a permanent state of exception, Meghan Sutherland argues that "in [zombie films], death asserts its immanence in the living and life asserts its immanence in the dead", thus death becomes a continuing state of being - a post-life existence that defies normative categories (CHRISTIE, 2011, p. 79)
