  <h3>HOLLINGER, FICÇÃO CIENTÍFICA</h3>

Science fiction is now, more clearly than ever, a subject-inprocess; its erstwhile 'fixed' identity has become indeterminate and changeable (HOLLINGER, 2000, p. 215)

<h3>HOLLINGER, FICÇÃO CIENTÍFICA, COLAPSO TEMPORAL, GÊNERO, CAMPO DISCURSIVO</h3>

Here I want to explore further the implications for genre science fiction of this 'collapse' of the future into the present, as implied in the transformation of science fiction from genre to discursive field. I also want to look at science fiction's own (occasional) recognition of itself as a casualty of this 'collapsed future.' (HOLLINGER, 2000, p. 216)

<h3>HOLLINGER, IMAGINÁRIO, FICÇÃO CIENTÍFICA</h3>

And this, ironically, at the same time as it has taken hold of popular consciousness in a completely unprecedented way. In fact, it is this increasing presence of science-fiction imagery and discourse within mainstream culture which provides one of the strongest arguments for the 'disappearance' of science fiction as a separate generic enterprise at the present time. In other words, as genre, science fiction is 'irrelevant,' because, as discourse, it has become so significant. The fin-de-millenium, for science fiction, spells the fin-de-genre (HOLLINGER, 2000, p. 217)

<h3>HOLLINGER, FICÇÃO CIENTÍFICA, METONÍMIA, EXTRAPOLAÇÃO, METÁFORA, ALEGORIA</h3>

Briefly, we can think of traditional science fiction- or 'first sf', to borrow John Clute's phrase- as a generic enterprise resulting from an increased cultural awareness of time and history; a more or less optimistic faith in progress, especially but not only technological progress; a valorization of the logic of cause and effect; and the replication of a ready-made aesthetics of realism with its linear narrative development and its assumed transparency of language. Metonymy and extrapolation, rather than metaphor and allegory, have been science fiction's characteristic imaginative modes (HOLLINGER, 2000, p. 217)

<h3>HOLLINGER, FICÇÃO CIENTÍFICA, APOCALIPSE, PENSAMENTO MILENIAL</h3>

These days science fiction is everywhere, as a discourse of choice through which to describe a present which perceives itself as both technological and apocalyptic. In fact, this is a present which perceives itself as already extending into the future. The implication here is that, when faced with the immediacy of millennial/ apocalyptic events, science fiction's future orientation becomes blocked and science fiction becomes a present-tense kind of literature. That is, it begins to function in the popular imagination more and more as a metaphorical discourse through which to describe/ construct the present, rather than as an extrapolative exercise through which to imagine the future.l0 In fact, as millennia! thinking catches up with science fiction, the future becomes nothing more than a kind of displaced version of the present (HOLLINGER, 2000, p. 217-218)


<h3>HOLLINGER, MODO DE PERCEPÇÃO, FICÇÃO CIENTÍFICA, ORIENTADA-PARA-O-FUTURO</h3>

For Csicsery-Ronay, however, science fiction is 'a mode of awareness' more than it is a textual field circumscribed by generic boundaries. He insists that, as imaginative enterprise, it 'is an inherently, and radically, future-oriented process'Y I am arguing here, however, for science fiction's transformation into a discursive field which is precisely not future-oriented. Another way to say this is that there is no process of cognitive estrangement in science fiction's current most prolific employment; future worlds are now where we feel ourselves to be most at home (HOLLINGER, 2000, p. 218)


<h3>HOLLINGER, DESENVOLVIMENTO POSITIVO, FICÇÃO CIENTÍFICA</h3>

While this new role has been touted by many as a positive development in science fiction's increasing acceptance as serious cultural production,18 at the same time the genre is challenged to respond to an historical moment which has appropriated its future visions into descriptions of the present, in a move which effectively collapses the future and the present into each other and threatens to leave us with an incapacity to imagine any future at all. The fin-de-millenium, for us, might also spell the fin-de-futur (HOLLINGER, 2000, p. 219)


<h3>HOLLINGER, HISTÓRIA, NOVELA HISTÓRICA</h3>

In 'Progress Versus Utopia, or Can We Imagine the Future?' Jameson writes of a loss of the sense of history - both past and future - as one of the markers of the present moment. He suggests that the historical novel began to disappear as a relevant genre because of a growing loss of a sense of the past since the midnineteenth century; the past becomes 'reduced to pretexts for so many glossy images'.22 (HOLLINGER, 2000, p. 220)

<h3>HOLLINGER, STAR WARS</h3>

Star Wars film series, which set their action 'long ago in a galaxy far away' (HOLLINGER, 2000, p. 220)
             
<h3>HOLLINGER, FICÇÃO CIENTÍFICA, RECONTEXTUALIZAÇÃO</h3>

As our impatient present, with the help of this appropriated imagebank, transforms its own sense of futurity in particularly postmodern ways, science fiction becomes (re)contextualized and so comes to 'mean' differently than in the past. What exactly is science fiction if its familiar icons - the alien, the cyborg, the spaceship, the environment of technology- represent our sense of the present to us? And what kinds of stories might demonstrate science fiction's contemporary sense of itself? (HOLLINGER, 2000, p. 222)
