<h3>SOHDI, EXTINÇÃO, COLONIALISMO</h3>
The rate and extent of human-mediated extinctions are debated, but there is general agreement that extinction rates have soared over the past few hundred years, largely as a result of <b>accelerated habitat destruction following European colonialism</b> and the subsequent global expansion of the human population during the twentieth century. Humans are implicated directly or indirectly in the 100- to 10,000-fold increase in the ‘‘natural’’ or ‘‘background’’ extinction rate that normally occurs as a consequence of gradual environmental change, newly established competitive interactions (by evolution or invasion), and occasional chance calamities such as fire, storms, or disease. (SOHDI et al., 2008:514)

<h3>SOHDI, ANTROPOCENO</h3>
Despite substantial prediction error, it is nevertheless certain that human actions are causing the structure and function of natural systems to unravel.(SOHDI et al., 2008:515)

<h3>SOHDI, EXTINÇÃO</h3>
The past five great extinctions shared some important commonalities: (1) they caused a catastrophic loss of global biodiversity; (2) they unfolded rapidly (at least in the context of evolutionary and geological time); (3) taxonomically, their impact was not random (that is, whole groups of related species were lost while other related groups remained largely unaffected); and (4) the survivors were often not previously dominant evolutionary groups. All four of these features are relevant to the current biodiversity crisis.(SOHDI et al., 2008:515)

<h3>SOHDI, ANTROPOCENO</h3>
The major ‘‘systematic drivers’’ of modern species loss are changes in land use (habitat loss degradation and fragmentation), overexploitation, invasive species, disease, climate change (global warming) connected to increasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and increases in nitrogen deposition. (SOHDI et al., 2008:515)

<h3>SOHDI, EXTINÇÃO</h3>
But ultimately, any phenomena that can cause mortality rates to exceed reproductive replacement over a sustained period can cause a species to become extinct. Such forces may act independently or synergistically, and it may be difficult to identify a single cause of a particular species extinction event. For instance, habitat loss may cause some extinctions directly by removing all individuals, but it can also be indirectly responsible for an extinction by facilitating the establishment of an invasive species or disease agent, improving access to human hunters, or altering biophysical conditions. As a result, any process that causes a population to dwindle may ultimately predispose that population to extinction. (SOHDI et al., 2008:515)

<h3>SOHDI, ANTROPOCENO</h3>
Evidence to date suggests that deforestation is currently, and is projected to continue to be, the prime direct and indirect cause of reported extirpations. For example, it is predicted that up to 21% of Southeast Asian forest species will be lost by 2100 because of past and ongoing deforestation. Similar projections exist for biotas in other regions. (SOHDI et al., 2008:515)

<h3>SOHDI, ANTROPOCENO</h3>
Overexploitation is also an important driver of extinctions among vertebrates and tends to operate synergistically with other drivers such as habitat loss. For example, roads and trails created to allow logging operations to penetrate into virgin forests make previously remote areas more accessible to human hunters, who can, in turn, cause the decline and eventual extirpation of forest species.(SOHDI et al., 2008:515) 

<h3>SOHDI, ANTROPOCENO</h3>
The ecosystem and biological community changes precipitated by invasive species represent another leading cause of biodiversity loss. Of 170 extinct species for which causes have been identified reliably, invasive species contributed directly to the demise of 91 (54%).(SOHDI et al., 2008:516)

<h3>SOHDI, ANTROPOCENO</h3>
Human-mediated climate change represents a potentially disastrous sleeping giant in terms of future biodiversity losses. Climate warming can affect species in five principal ways: (1) alterations of species densities (including altered community composition and structure); (2) range shifts, either poleward or upward in elevation; (3) behavioral changes, such as the phenology (seasonal timing of life cycle events) of migration, breeding, and flowering; (4) changes in morphology, such as body size; and (5) reduction in genetic diversity that leads to inbreeding depression. (SOHDI et al., 2008:516)
