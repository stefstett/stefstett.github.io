            <h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, CHAUVINISMO HUMANO, OCIDENTE, ANTROPOCENTRISMO </h3>
            
            IN OUR ENLIGHTENED TIMES, WHEN MOST FORMS OF CHAUVINISM HAVE BEEN
abandoned, at least in theory, by those who consider themselves progressive,
Western ethics still appears to retain, at its very heart, a fundamental form of
chauvinism, namely, human chauvinism. For both popular Western thought
and most Western ethical theories assume that both value and morality can
ultimately be reduced to matters of interest or concern to the class of humans (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 36)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, CHAUVINISMO HUMANO </h3>
            
           The orthodox defense of human chauvinism argues that it is inevitable
that humans sh~uld be taken as the exclusive subjects of value and morality.
Humans are umquely and exclusively qualified for moral consideration and
attributions of value, according to this defense either because the human
s~~cies alone does, as a matter of fact, possess properties which are a preconditiOn f?r s.u~h ascriptions or because, as a matter of the definition or the logic
or the significance of moral concepts in natural language, such considerations
are restricted as a matter of logic to the human species (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 37)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, CHAUVINISMO HUMANO </h3>
            
            The at~e~pt to preserve human chauvinism in an unchallengeable form
through defimtwns mvolves the fallacy of taking definitions to be selfvalidating and unchallengeable, and appears to be based on the confusion of
ab~reviative definitions with those involving or presupposing substantive
cl~~s~ such as creative definitions, which may be accepted or rejecte (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 37)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, CLUBE MORAL</h3>
            
            Since a similar move could obviously be
employed to limit membership of the Moral Club to, say, white male humans
in place of humans generally, it is plain that such a definitional argument does
far too much and is capable of use to produce completely unacceptable conclusions (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 38)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, DEFINIÇÃO</h3>
            
            The attempt to settle substantive issues ''by definitioq'' is both philosophically facile and methodologically unsound and is especially so when
there are clearly alternative definitions which would not settle the issue
in the same way (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 38)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, HUMANIDADE, MORALIDADE, IDENTIDADE </h3>
            
            More generally, any attempt to derive a logically necessary connection
between humanity itself and the applicability of morality is bound to fail. For
creatures anatomically and zoologically distinct from humans which are identical with humans in terms of all morally relevant features are logically possible, upsetting any logical linkage. But attempts to establish a logical tie
between humanity and morality through features which all and only humans
possess and which are themselves linked logically to morality would, of
course, involve a modal fallacy, namely, that of substituting a contingent
equivalence within an opaque modal context of logical necessity (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 39)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, DEFINIÇÃO, CHAUVINISMO HUMANO </h3>
            
            What this contingent form of human chauvinism has to produce then, in
order to establish its case, is a set of characteristics which satisfy the following
conditions of adequacy:
1. The set of characteristics must be possessed by at least all properly
functioning humans, since to omit any significant group usually
considered subject to moral consideration, such as infants, young
children, primitive tribesmen, etc., and to allow that it was permissible to treat these groups in the way it is considered permissible to treat non-humans, that is, as mere instruments, would certainly be
repugnant to modem moral sensibilities and would offend common
intuitions as to the brotherhood of man, the view that all humans are
possessors of inalienable rights. Thus human chauvinism, if it is to
produce a coherent theory which does not unacceptably rule out
some groups of humans, must find some set of features common to
the most diverse members of humankind, from Rio Tinto executives
to hunter-gatherer tribes of Amazonian Indians, from those. who
engage in highly abstract activities such as logic and mathematics to
those who cannot, from the literate and cultured to the illiterate and
uncouth, from the poet and professor to the infant. This alone will be
oo~y~~. . 2. In order for human chauvinism to be justified, this set of charactenstics must not be possessed by any non-human.
3. The set of characteristics must be not merely morally relevant but
sufficient to justify, in a non-circular way, the cut-off of moral
consideration at exactly the right point. If human chauvinism is to
avoid the charge of arbitrariness and unjustifiability and to demonstrate its inevitability and the impossibility of alternatives, it must
emerge from the characteristics why items not having them II_Iay be
used as mere instruments to serve the interests of those which do
possess them. There must be some explanatory logical connection
between the set of characteristics and membership of the Moral
Club (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 39-40)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, HUMANIDADE, FRACASSO, DEFINIÇÕES </h3>

altruism (1, 2); being capable of being a Christian, or capable of rehgwus
faith (1, 3); being able to produce the items of (human) civilization and culture
(1, 3). (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 41-42)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, HUMANO, VALOR, INTERESSE </h3>
            
            One
abstract argument which is supposed to establish that values are, or must be,
determined through the interests of humans or persons-a central argument
underlying chauvinism-takes the following form:
A. Values are determined through the preference rankings of valuers
(the no detachable values assumption). , .
B. Valuers' preference rankings are determined through valuers mterests (the preference reduction thesis). C. Valuers are humans [persons] (the species assumption).
D. Therefore, values are determined through human interests [through
the interests of persons] (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 42-43)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, VALOR, MORALIDADE, INTERESSE HUMANO </h3>
            
            Hence, it is sometimes concluded, not only is it perfectly acceptable for
humans to reduce matters of value and morality to matters of human interest,
but moreover there is no rational or possible alternative to doing so; any
alternative is simply incoherent (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 43)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, SUPOSIÇÕES FALACIOSAS </h3>
            
            Although this argument does not, so far as we are aware, appear anywhere with its premises explicitly stated, it does seem to reflect the sorts of
consideration those who claim that there is no rational or coherent alternative
to organizing everything in human interests usually have in mind. Of course
once the premises are exposed, it is easier to see that this initially persuasive
argument, like others in the area, rests on fallacious assumptions (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 43)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, CLASSE DE BASE </h3>
            
            Another familiar, and appealing, variation we have already bracketed
into the form of the argument given; namely the replacement of humans as
base class by persons (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 43)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, ELITE, CHAUVINISMO </h3>
            
            Typically such theories take the goal to be
the furtherance of the interest of a privileged class; for example, the goal may
be taken to be determined in terms of the interests, concerns, advantage, or
welfare of the class of humans, or of persons, or of sentient creatures, depending on the type of chauvinism (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 48)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, INSTRUMENTALISMO, TEORIAS </h3>
            
            In particular, human chauvinist theories are,
characteristically, instrumentalist theories. In contrast, an item is valued intrinsically where it is valued for its own sake, and not merely as a means to
something further; and an intrinsic-value theory allows that some items are
intrinsically valuable. Intrinsic theories then, contrast with instrumental
theories, and what "intrinsic" tells us is no more than that the item taken as
intrinsically valuable is not valued merely as a means to some goal, i.e., is not
merely instrumentally valued. Accordingly detached value theories, since
disjoint from instrumental theories, are a subclass of intrinsic value theories;
and they are a proper subclass since intrinsic values need not be detached (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 48)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, INTERESSE HUMANO</h3>
            
            Thus it is with the assumption of human chauvinist instrumentalism that goals are exclusively determinable in terms of human interest. The basic, convincing and self..:evident
character of this assumption rests on nothing more than the shared beliefs of
the privileged class of humans concerning the paramount and exclusive import~nce of regarding their own interests and concerns, on a valuational assumption or goal which is ''self-evident'' because it is advantageous and is
habitual (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 49)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, INSTRUMENTALISMO </h3>
            
            The fact that the goal of an instrumental account must be taken as itself
valuable gives rise to two choices. In the first, the goal is taken as itself
instrumentally valuable, which creates an infinite regress. For if the end,
reason, or assignment for which other itenis are instrumentally valuable is
itself only instrumentally valuable, then there must in tum be some other end,
reason, or assignment in terms of which it is valuable (by definition of instrumental) (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 50)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, DILEMA, CHAUVINISMO HUMANO </h3>
            
            This abstract dilemma for human-chauvinist instrumentalism is illustrated in a concrete case by Passmore's procedure in Man's Responsibility for
Nature; for Passmore (1) wishes to say that there is no coherent alternative to
instrumental values, that an item is valuable insofar as it serves human interest, and (2) wants to explain the unique value attributed to humans in terms of
their production of valuable civilized and cultural items. But (2) involves the
admission of values, that of civilized items, which cannot be valuable in the
way (1) states, and indeed (2) amounts to the admission of noninstrumental
values. The proposed account is inconsistent because if intrinsic values are
admissible in the case of civilized items, they cannot be logically incoherent
in the way ( 1) claims (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 51)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, NÃO-ARBITRÁRIO, NÃO-CHAUVINISTA </h3>
            
            But any explanation capable of justifying this valuation in a nonarbitrary and nonchauvinistic way would have to refer to properties of humans and would have to say something l~ke: ''Humans
are uniquely valuable because they alone have valuable propert1e~ ~· y, .z' : ..
or produce valuable items A, B, C .... '' The list of proposed dtstmgmshmg
features already considered above is usually what will be employed here (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 51-52)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, CHAUVINISMO HUMANO </h3>
            
            Thus the case for the inevitability of human chauvinism, that alternatives to it must be based on an incoherent and logically and epistemically
defective account of values, namely a noninstrumental account, has not been
established by these arguments (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 52)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY,  CHAUVINISMO HUMANO</h3>
            
            There is then, given this point and the annular model, no need to opt for
the position of Leopold16 as the only alternative to human (or animal)
chauvinism, that is, for a position which simply transfers to natural items the
full set of rights and obligations applicable to humans, leading to such nonsignificance as that rocks have obligations to mountains. Distinctions between
the moral constraints appropriate to different types of items can be recognized
without leading back to human chauvinism (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 56)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, CHAUVINISMO HUMANO, ECOLOGIA </h3>
            
            The ecological restatement of the strong version of human chauvinism,
according to which items outside the privileged human class have zero intrinsic value, is the Dominion thesis, 18the view that the earth and all its nonhuman contents exist or are available for man's benefit and to serve his interests
and, hence, that man is entitled to manipulate the world and its systems as he
wants, that is, in his interests (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 56)

<h3>ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, EMPOBRECIMENTO, MUNDO NÃO-HUMANO</h3>
            
            Witness the impoverishment of the nonhuman world, the assaults
being made on tropical rainforests, surviving temperate wildernesses, wild
animals, the oceans, to list only a few of the victims of man's assault on the
natural world. Observe also the associated measures to bring primitive or
recalcitrant peoples into the Western consumer society and the spread of
human-chauvinist value systems. The time is fast approaching when questions
raised by an environmental ethic will cease to involve live options. As things
stand at present, however, the ethical issues generated by the preemptionsespecially given the weakness and inadequacy of the ideological and valuetheoretical basis on which the damaging chauvinistic transformation of the
world is premised and the viability of alternative environmental ethics-are
not merely of theoretical interest but are among the most important and urgent
questions of our times, and perhaps the most important questions that human
beings, whose individual or group self-interest is the source of most environmental problems, have ever asked themselves (ROUTLEY & ROUTLEY, 1973, p. 57)
