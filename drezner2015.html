              <h3>DREZNER, ZUMBI, METÁFORA</h3>
            
            As Peter Dendle notes, "It is clear that the zombie holocaust vividly painted in movies and video games have tapped into a deep-seated anxiety about society. Zombies have been an obvious methaphor for medical maladies, mob rule, and Marxist dialectics (DREZNER, 2015, p. 5)
            
              <h3>DREZNER, ZUMBI, CIÊNCIA</h3>
            
            The living dead appear to ressonate more than other paranormal actors in an age of uncertainty. Scientists and doctors acknowledge that, in contrast to vampires or demons, some variation of a zombie could exist in our physical world (DREZNER, 2015, p. 7)
            
              <h3>DREZNER, DISPUTA, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            The traditional narrative of the zombie canon also looks different from stories about other paranormal beings. Zombie stories usually and in one of two ways - the elimination/subjugation of all zombies, or the eradication of humanity from the face of the earth (DREZNER, 2015, p. 9-10)
            
              <h3>DREZNER, CIÊNCIA, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            Thsi brief survey of the zombie literatura reveals an immediate and dauting problem. The humanities and the hard sciences have devoted sustained attention to the problem posed by reanimated corpses feasting upon human flesh. The social sciences, however, are curiously deficient in this line of inquiry. From its founding to 2011, the advisory board for the Zombie Research Society did not contain a single social scientist. When social scientists mention zombies, they usually do so only for metaphorical reasons (DREZNER, 2015, p. 12)
            
              <h3>DREZNER, ESTADO DE NATUREZA, HOBBES</h3>
            
            When Thomas Hobbes described the state of nature as one of "continuall feare, and danger of violent death, and the life of man solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short," zombies were either on his mind or outside his door (DREZNER, 2015, p. 13)
            
              <h3>DREZNER, ZUMBI, POLÍTICA</h3>
            
            IN the most important ways, flesh-eating ghouls are an exemplar for salient concerns about the global body politic. Zombies are the perfect twenty-first century threat: they are not well understood by serious analysts, they posses protean capabilities, and the challenges they popse tostates are very, very grave (DREZNER, 2015, p. 19)
            
              <h3>DREZNER, ROMERO, BROOKS, KIRKMAN, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            Perhaps people would respond to a real night of the living dead in a different manner than George Romero, Max Brooks, or Robert Kirkman posit. This possibility will be considered - but as we shall see, there is a hidden heterogeneity to the zombie canon (DREZNER, 2015, p. 20)
            
              <h3>DREZNER, DEFINIÇÃO, ZUMBI </h3>
            
            Consistent with the Zombie Reseach Society, I choose treat the zombie as a biological definable, animated being occupying a human host, with a desire to eat human flesh (DREZNER, 2015, p. 23)
            
              <h3>DREZNER, ZUMBI, DEFINIÇÃO</h3>
            
            Surveying the state of the zombie literature, the two sharpest disagreements are about their origins and their capabilities. This provides us, as social scientists, with an excellent means to determine whether zombie-specific variables - their origins and their speed - have a dramatic effect on outcomes in international relations (DREZNER, 2015, p. 26)
            
              <h3>DREZNER, PÓS-HUMANIDADE</h3>
            
            Posthuman actors would be seen as rapidly rising power - and no one would deny that their preference for human flesh would represent radically revisionist war aims (DREZNER, 2015, p. 45)
            
              <h3>DREZNER, ZUMBI, INTELIGÊNCIA</h3>

            As previously noted, some zombies in the canon start out possessing strategic intelligence, making them more than capable of recognizing the virtues of tactical agreements with some humans (DREZNER, 2015, p. 47)
            
              <h3>DREZNER, LIBERALISMO, ZUMBI</h3>
            
            A deeper cut, however, reveals that the liberal paradigm can offer significant analytical bite. Romantic zombie comedies - rom-zom-coms, for short - contain both implicit and explicit elements of liberalism. Ruben Fleisher's <i>Zombieland</i> (2009) is about the articulation and adherence to well-defined rules for surviving in a zombie-infested landscape (DREZNER, 2015, p. 55)
            
              <h3>DREZNER, ZUMBI, DOYLE, MILITARES</h3>
            
            In both Danny Doyle's film <i>28 Days Later</i> (2002) and Brian Keene's novel <i>The Rising</i>, we see military troops devote considerable effort to imprisioning women for use as sex slaves (DREZNER, 2015, p. 83)
