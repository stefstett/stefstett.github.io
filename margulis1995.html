            <h3>MARGULIS, SIMBIOSE, ORGANISMO</h3>
            
            Symbiosis is a physical association between organisms,
the living together of organisms of different species in
the same place at the same time (MARGULIS, 1995, s.n.p.)
            
            <h3>MARGULIS, SIMBIOSE, SIMBIOGÊNESE</h3>
            
            Symbiosis has nothing to do with cost or benefit. The
benefit/cost people have perverted the science with
invidious economic analogies. The contention is not
over modern symbioses, simply the living together of
unlike organisms, but over whether "symbiogenesis"
— long-term symbioses that lead to new forms of life
— has occurred and is still occurring. The importance
of symbiogenesis as a major source of evolutionary
change is what is debated. I contend that
symbiogenesis is the result of long-term living together
— staying together, especially involving microbes- -
and that it's the major evolutionary innovator in all
lineages of larger nonbacterial organisms (MARGULIS, 1995, s.n.p.)
            
            <h3>MARGULIS, COMPORTAMENTO </h3>
            
            The only way behavior changes in science is
that certain people die and differently behaving people
take their places (MARGULIS, 1995, s.n.p.)
            
            <h3>MARGULIS, GERAÇÃO DE VARIEDADE</h3>
            
            While Gould and the others tend to believe that species
only diverge from one another, I claim that — more
important in generation of variation — species form
new composite entities by fusion and merger (MARGULIS, 1995, s.n.p.)
            
            <h3>MARGULIS, MICROORGANISMOS</h3>
            
            Thus, in
every fungus, animal, or plant (and in most protoctists),
at least two distinct genealogies exist side by side.
That, in itself, is a clue that at some point these
organelles were distinct microorganisms that joined
forces (MARGULIS, 1995, s.n.p.)
            
            <h3>MARGULIS, REPRODUÇÃO, ISOMORFIA</h3>
            
            The growth, reproduction, and
communication of these moving, alliance-forming
bacteria become isomorphic with our thought, with our
happiness, our sensitivities and stimulations. If mine is
a correct view, it organizes a great deal of knowledge (MARGULIS, 1995, s.n.p.)
            
            <h3>MARGULIS, GAIA </h3>
            
            The Gaia hypothesis states that the temperature of the
planet, the oxidation state and other chemistry of all of
the gases of the lower atmosphere (except helium,
argon, and other nonreactive ones) are produced and
maintained by the sum of life. We explored how this
could be. How could the temperature of the planet be
regulated by living beings? How could the atmospheric
gas composition — the 20-percent oxygen and the one
to two parts per million methane, for example — be
actively maintained by living matter? (MARGULIS, 1995, s.n.p.)
            
            <h3>MARGULIS, GAIA</h3>
            
            Some critics are worried that the
Gaia hypothesis says the environment will respond to
any insults done to it and the natural systems will take
care of the problems. This, they maintain, gives industries a license to pollute. Yes, Gaia will take care
of itself; yes, environmental excesses will be
ameliorated, but it's likely that such restoration of the
environment will occur in a world devoid of people  (MARGULIS, 1995, s.n.p.)
            
            <h3>MARGULIS, LOVELOCK, ORGANISMO</h3>
            
            Lovelock's position is to
let the people believe that Earth is an organism,
because if they think it is just a pile of rocks they kick
it, ignore it, and mistreat it. If they think Earth is an
organism, they'll tend to treat it with respect. To me,
this is a helpful cop-out, not science (MARGULIS, 1995, s.n.p.)
            
            <h3>MARGULIS, GAIA IS A TOUGH BITCH </h3>
            
            Gaia is a tough bitch — a system that has worked for
over three billion years without people. This planet's
surface and its atmosphere and environment will
continue to evolve long after people and prejudice are
gone (MARGULIS, 1995, s.n.p.)
